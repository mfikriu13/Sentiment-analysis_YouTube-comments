And, many climate models don&#39;t take methane into account, which is a MUCH worse greenhouse gas than CO2, especially in the short term, as many consider its effects to be 80 times worse. As for the CO2, itself, it might stay in the atmosphere for centuries or even thousands of years and about 25% of it could stay forever (check out NASA&#39;s graphic: Major Greenhouse Gas Sources, Lifespans, and Possible Added Heat).

There are two other factors: 1) the loss of living biomass -- or the conversion of resources that would otherwise support them into non-living things. What&#39;s the connection? If Carbon can&#39;t accumulate in the standing stock of living biomass, then it must accumulate somewhere, and it does! In our atmosphere and in our oceans! Thus global warming and loss of ecological biomass are one and the same problem. 2) the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. Natural systems can&#39;t keep up. Solution: Simultaneously reduce the rate of greenhouse gas emissions, embark on a massive adaptive ecological restoration focusing on the establishment of food forests capable of sustaining BOTH human AND ecological organisms. Place as much non-residential structures and infrastructure as possible underground or in space, reserving the surface of the Earth for living things. Create an ecologically literate population that recognizes that human survival, health and well-being is totally dependent upon the survival, health and well-being of or internal and external ecosystem, redefine wealth as the same, build an ecologically based and constrained economy using ecologically based and ecologically constrained technology. Act as the keystone species and build up the capacity of the ecosystem to sustain human life, using the excess productive capacity to grow the human economy. That&#39;s our only viable way forward.

It will get worse and worse until it hits your area of the world. The people who are feeling it now are those preparing and those waiting and ignoring the truth will be unprepared for what is coming. If the world goes through a rapid shift from climate change the poles could change positions and affect the inner layers of our planet. Science is a tricky thing to understand but common sense with some basic knowledge will help you see the truth. There is evidence in the past where oceans have eroded areas significantly above sea levels today. A rapid change can cause massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Tsunamis so large its hard to comprehend. Flooding so terrible and violent it sends shock waves disrupting volcanoes and underground plates deep underground to shift. People have no idea the cause and effect of climate change and what reality could really look like under certain conditions. A major fault disrupted from earthquakes and a super volcano could be happen releasing so much carbon increasing damage world wide. Global warming could potentially create an artificial ice age that would starve out humanity and wipe all life on this planet. Billions will die and billions more will suffer struggling to survive day to day migrating around the world to escape to safer places. Don&#39;t say it won&#39;t happen because evidence shows it happens naturally all the time. We live short lifespans and knowledge is lost every time a major disaster happens. Knowledge preserved is misinterpreted and not understood completely. Languages lost and pictographs can be misleading. We must calm our world to restore what is lost of nature. Nature helps balance our world and if you look at how much humanity took and created from this world you will see the loss. Once you destroy nature and cover it up you change the environment overtime and climate change results disrupting the natural flow. The past data that has been examined will be wrong and misleading with future models. This planet is 71% water and only 30% of the land has forests left. 70% of the earth is covered by water and humanity took 70% of land from nature build roads, cities and industry. Climate change and human development continues to reduce the forests left on this planet. Without forests there is no life on this planet. There are only two outcomes for the future if we don&#39;t change now. Ice age from some naturally disaster or nuclear war or the earth will reach a catastrophic point of warming flooding the earth and eroding all land on the planet. The world will become an ocean with no land anywhere. It would be billions of years before any landmass starts developing again. Aquatic life will be the only life on the planet.',\n",

       "  'Dinosaurs would laugh at people that claim the planet is overheating. Compared to the Mesozoic (Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous) it is now very very very cold. Dinosaurs lived in a climate that had moderate temperatures at the poles. Dinosaurs lived in this hot climate for 160 million years and it was this climate that allowed them to get so big. Higher temperatures means more evaporation, which means longer wet periods around the equator, warm climate also causes more CO2 (and not the other way around, as oceans emit it when warming and absorb it when cooling, but they take a long time to change temperature), which boosts plant growth. This resulted in so much plant food that herbivore Dinosaurs were able to get so enormous. Then carnivores followed. This periode not only had the largest land animals ever but also the largest flying animals ever and a sea full of giants of which the largest ichtiosaurs rival the blue whale. <br>Only in winter did temperature get below zero C degrees. Compared to the last 500 million years we live in a very cold period. We live in an ice age. However it is currently a mild period within the ice age called an inter-glacial, as opposed to the glacial where the ice comes much further. It is an ice age because there is ice at the poles, which is very unusual in the history of the earth.<br>History proves that hotter is better. Compare the biodiversity around the equator to that on the poles. Many animals are cold blooded and can&#39;t live in cold areas. But even mammals profit from warmth. The Holocene optimum was hot, which resulted in a huge explosion of the evolution of mammals. <br><br>It is possible that the current ice age we live in is ending. Currently the northern hemisphere has milder winters due to the Milankovitch cycles (changes in orbit and tilt of the planet). Apart from that there is solar activity, clouds, radiation from space, currents in oceans and atmosphere, continental drift, albedo effect and greenhouse gasses that influence the climate. Greenhouse gasses are only a portion of this and the only greenhouse gas that is actually relevant is water vapor, which is 95% of greenhouse gasses. CO2 effect is very minor. This is proven by the fact that in the past CO2 always followed climate almost a century behind temperature. It is primary plant food, and while it is a greenhouse gas, its ability as such is very low and decreases per molecule when CO2 increases.<br>Factors that due influence climate are albedo effect (how much does a certain terrain absorb of reflect heat from the sun), urban heat island and aerosols that decrease the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface.<br><br>Both the medieval warm period and Roman warm period were at least as warm as today. But even those are still cold compared to the Eemien, Holocene optimum, the Mesozoic and the Permian. <br><br>The people dying from weather has decreased 95% in the last century. The amount of area burned by forest fires have gone down (despite people setting fires) and the amount of hurricanes that reach US land is lower, the strongest tornadoes have decreased.<br><br>Read the book &quot;A Very Convenient Warming&quot; or watch the documentary: &quot;Climate the Movie: The Cold Truth&quot;, it can be watched for free on Youtube for independent scientific sources about the climate.<br><br>Unfortunatly there are many people that deny the Milankovitch cycles, solar activity, cosmic radiation, albedo, aerosols, the effect of clouds, water vapor being the most important greenhouse gas,  the effect of currents and continental drift. They claim it is only CO2. And these far left woke people call others climate deniers, whereas they themselves deny all the natural causes that changed the climate very dramatically and often much faster for 4.5 billion years.<br><br>Here in the Netherlands the last two springs were the coldest we&#39;ve had for decades. The summers of the last 2 years have been mainly wet and relatively cool as well.',\n",

Yes, they keep some heat in, about 20 degrees, but they block out 194 degrees for a net temperature of 174.\\r<br>Gilbert Plass is the father of CO2 warming. His paper in 1955 THE CARBON DIOXIDE THEORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE started all this idiocy.  The first sentence of the Abstract for his papers  states:\\r<br>\\r<br>‚ÄúThe most recent calculations of the infra-red flux in the region of the 15 micron CO2, band show that the average surface temperature of the earth increases 3.6‚Äù C if the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is doubled and decreases 3.8‚Äô C if the CO2 amount is halved, provided that no other factors change which influence the radiation balance.‚Äù<br>\\r<br>You get warming ONLY if added CO2 does not change the radiation balance, meaning the heat entering does not fall with added CO2.\\r<br>Before satellites, all scientists worked from the assumption that the sun mostly produced visible light and little heat.  That visible light warmed the earth as the levels of CO2 and water vapor blocked out all the sun‚Äôs heat.  Adding CO2 will not block out more incoming Sun heat as the was so little coming in to to begin with.  But this is wrong.  \\r<br>\\r<br>Heat is the majority of the sun‚Äôs radiation.  30% of the sun‚Äôs heat makes it past the atmosphere, so adding more CO2 does change the radiation balance.  Added CO2 blocks out more sun heat cooling the earth and reversing the greenhouse effect!  Which is what Plass‚Äôs paper said.  Plass assumed that added CO2 did not change the radiation balance, so added CO2 created a warmer earth, but he was wrong, added CO2 created a cooler earth. \\r<br>250 above, only 76 degrees below.  Cooler earth hotter atmosphere.  The Troposphere is getting warmer with added CO2, not the surface.  The CO2 in the troposphere is absorbing more incoming sun heat and getting warmer.\\r<br>We are getting warmer, but that is because the Little Ice Age (LIA), ended in 1850.  The Earth has been warming up since then.  Snow has been melting and the oceans have been warming up.   With less and less cold left over from the LIA the warming is accelerating.  We are going back to the Earth that existed in the last Inter-Glacial Period when Iceland was baren of ice and the seas were 26 feet higher than today.  \\r<br>20,000 years ago the seas were 110 feet lower than today.  This is how it goes on the Earth, warm to cold, low seas to high seas.  This is just the first time mankind has had the education and intelligence to understand what is happening.  \\r<br>Neanderthals lived through the last Ice Age but they didn‚Äôt know there was an ice age, it was just the way it was.  Earlier hominids had no idea that they were in an inter-glacial age.  All they knew was it was it was warm.   \\r<br>Plass‚Äôs work is on the internet just google and read it for yourself, you only need to read the first sentence in the abstract.',\n",

With the sudden catastrophic unprecedented rise (more accurately a &quot;huge jump&quot;) in global average seas-surface temperatures in 2023, the scientists who have been showing climate models that include global tipping points and changes in the aerosol masking effect have been proven correct. Continued present conditions and future global heating that&#39;s already &quot;in the pipeline&quot; already guarantee climate chaos will continue to intensify and worsen regardless of what we do today.  Rapid heating of the oceans and land/air temperatures is unfolding more exponentially than gradually, so now, in 2024, we know that reaching +3¬∫C is no longer a question, but a certainty, and the data suggests that it will likely happen much sooner than &quot;by the end of the century&quot;... like perhaps &quot;by the end of this decade&quot; is a more realistic forecast, given all the new data and the ever-changing weather that we have been experiencing since this video was made.  And sadly, the situation is and will continue to get worse and more suffering will continue to grow, as starving people (including lots of drought-stricken small farmers as was so skillfully reported in this cutting edge Forbes report). Many farms will no longer able to grow food for the world, especially small and medium-sized farms (which are the opposite of the increased reliance on eating factory-farmed pigs, cows, chickens, etc., in terms of carbon pollution) .  --- This climate-driven reduction/collapse of humanity&#39;s ability to grow and store large amounts of food (especially grains) has already started, and is combining with crashing fertility rates in many parts of the world on a path to global population decline.  Many climate refugees are already forced by worsening drought to leave their homes and lives to migrate to cities and to more northern latitudes. Meanwhile, it&#39;s a huge oversight that many climate studies still fail to consider the aerosol masking effect, which is being reduced more and more with less sulfer in marine fuels and with each coal plant closure, etc. As we burn cleaner marine fuels and  less coal, we also reduce the amount of reflective aerosols. These aerosol pollutants are harmful to breathe, but they conversely/ironically directly slow the warming caused by their counterparts: the greenhouse gasses.  When the new requirements for marine fuels kicked in, it immediately triggered a sudden increased heating effect, especially in ocean surface temperatures in heavily-trafficed shipping lanes.

The federal government isn&#39;t, however, passing legislation restricting the sale of private jets. Worldwide, no government is passing legislation against the building, purchasing, and use of superyachts, which dump an average of 500 gallons of gasoline into our oceans every hour. We will always have oil and gas. What&#39;s happening is that the elites are consolidating the use of this energy source. Let&#39;s play this game theory out further. All vehicles will soon monitor your distance travelled. You will then be allotted a fixed number of miles per day, week, and year. When you travel beyond your allotment you will be taxed, meanwhile elites on private jets and superyachts will have no restrictions. &quot;Global warming&quot; will be the excuse that elites use to monopolize energy and control the masses.',\n",

In 1938, Guy Callendar connected carbon dioxide increases in Earth&#39;s atmosphere to global warming. 100 years later people didn&#39;t take global warming seriously in the 1990&#39;s. 30 years later people are still not taking it seriously. Well the warnings were given over 100 years ago and nobody listened and it could of been prevented with alternative technologies. Money destroyed the planet. Is it possible that the human race did the same thing on mars and escaped to planet earth millions of years ago. If earths magnetic field shifts due to global warming then a great flood of the earth will happen then the oceans will boil off from the sun bombarding our planet from a shift in our protective field thus earth becomes mars. We need to find another home or face the same fate as mars. We can make mars habitable in a 50 year timeline and stop the earth from a global catastrophe if everyone worked together. Money is just a thing people made up and can be discarded. When it comes to the human races survival then money is irrelevant.',\n",
