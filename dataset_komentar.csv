And, many climate models don&#39;t take methane into account, which is a MUCH worse greenhouse gas than CO2, especially in the short term, as many consider its effects to be 80 times worse. As for the CO2, itself, it might stay in the atmosphere for centuries or even thousands of years and about 25% of it could stay forever (check out NASA&#39;s graphic: Major Greenhouse Gas Sources, Lifespans, and Possible Added Heat). See what&#39;s happened in just the last few decades and imagine what it&#39;ll be like even one hundred years from now and realise that that&#39;s only the start of what&#39;s coming!",0

I replied that spaceweather from the Sun is predictable with regard to a number of its cycles. There is the 11/22 year cycle beloved by radio hams, the 350 to 400 year cycle to which I have mentioned, and the 12,000 year catastrophe cycle that definitely is worth a mention. The last two cycles are ongoing currently. It is the second, the 350 to 400 year cycle, a Grand Solar Minimum, 2008 to 2050, which is causing the havoc everyone is now aware of. This time around it has the prefix of &#39;Grand&#39; because of its enhanced effects. A visit online to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square will enable you to see the effect of the previous event. Look up &#39;Frost Fairs&#39; on the River Thames. One-foot thick ice covered the River and the northern hemisphere of Earth suffered COLD. Look today at North America and see that almost the whole has extremely cold weather.

There are two other factors: 1) the loss of living biomass -- or the conversion of resources that would otherwise support them into non-living things. What&#39;s the connection? If Carbon can&#39;t accumulate in the standing stock of living biomass, then it must accumulate somewhere, and it does! In our atmosphere and in our oceans! Thus global warming and loss of ecological biomass are one and the same problem. 2) the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. Natural systems can&#39;t keep up. Solution: Simultaneously reduce the rate of greenhouse gas emissions, embark on a massive adaptive ecological restoration focusing on the establishment of food forests capable of sustaining BOTH human AND ecological organisms. Place as much non-residential structures and infrastructure as possible underground or in space, reserving the surface of the Earth for living things. Create an ecologically literate population that recognizes that human survival, health and well-being is totally dependent upon the survival, health and well-being of or internal and external ecosystem, redefine wealth as the same, build an ecologically based and constrained economy using ecologically based and ecologically constrained technology. Act as the keystone species and build up the capacity of the ecosystem to sustain human life, using the excess productive capacity to grow the human economy. That&#39;s our only viable way forward.

I looked at the outlook for this winter, and the Pacific NW (where I spent the last 17 years) is predicted to be colder and wetter.  Rising prices forced me to join a growing exodus, but I certainly won&#39;t miss the weather: every year was colder and wetter.  Prior to moving this year, my neighbors still had their furnaces on in the morning in June.  That&#39;s a lot of wasted energy.  <br><br>I read some models predict that temperatures will also fall in western Europe when Arctic ice clogs the jet stream that brings warmer air to Europe.  <br><br>Colder winters have led far too many people to claim that global warming is a hoax by liberals, but the exact reason why is never given.  Indeed, my home state is pounded by snow and brutal Canadian air that makes it broke breaking cold in winter, but this isn&#39;t proof of a hoax.  It&#39;s proof that weather isn&#39;t easy to predict.  Deniers use these unknowns as validation that it isn&#39;t happening as fast or as dramatically as some have warned.

Also <br>Phoenix&#39;s population has expanded exponentially since its incorporation in 1881 to the present from a few tens of thousands to a few million. This has dramatically increased the Urban Heat Island effect resulting in temperatures 10¬∞F (5¬∞C) higher during the day (Scientific American, 2019). This alone explains any record high temperatures. As I&#39;m sure you are aware, Phoenix is in the Sonoran desert, which is characterised by long summers and extremely high temperatures.

It will get worse and worse until it hits your area of the world. The people who are feeling it now are those preparing and those waiting and ignoring the truth will be unprepared for what is coming. If the world goes through a rapid shift from climate change the poles could change positions and affect the inner layers of our planet. Science is a tricky thing to understand but common sense with some basic knowledge will help you see the truth. There is evidence in the past where oceans have eroded areas significantly above sea levels today. A rapid change can cause massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Tsunamis so large its hard to comprehend. Flooding so terrible and violent it sends shock waves disrupting volcanoes and underground plates deep underground to shift. People have no idea the cause and effect of climate change and what reality could really look like under certain conditions. A major fault disrupted from earthquakes and a super volcano could be happen releasing so much carbon increasing damage world wide. Global warming could potentially create an artificial ice age that would starve out humanity and wipe all life on this planet. Billions will die and billions more will suffer struggling to survive day to day migrating around the world to escape to safer places. Don&#39;t say it won&#39;t happen because evidence shows it happens naturally all the time. We live short lifespans and knowledge is lost every time a major disaster happens. Knowledge preserved is misinterpreted and not understood completely. Languages lost and pictographs can be misleading. We must calm our world to restore what is lost of nature. Nature helps balance our world and if you look at how much humanity took and created from this world you will see the loss. Once you destroy nature and cover it up you change the environment overtime and climate change results disrupting the natural flow. The past data that has been examined will be wrong and misleading with future models. This planet is 71% water and only 30% of the land has forests left. 70% of the earth is covered by water and humanity took 70% of land from nature build roads, cities and industry. Climate change and human development continues to reduce the forests left on this planet. Without forests there is no life on this planet. There are only two outcomes for the future if we don&#39;t change now. Ice age from some naturally disaster or nuclear war or the earth will reach a catastrophic point of warming flooding the earth and eroding all land on the planet. The world will become an ocean with no land anywhere. It would be billions of years before any landmass starts developing again. Aquatic life will be the only life on the planet.",0

The sun&#39;s heat is not changing in intensity. Also yes it has increased 1.5 on average, some places may not have changed yet, and some may have increased by more than 1.5 its just an average after all. In my area, it has not snowed in 20 years (really usual) which makes sense if temps increased by 1.5 because the coldest nights we would get would be near zero, now it&#39;s always just a tad bit above zero which means it can&#39;t snow at all.  <br><br>It‚Äôs unfortunate that your are dismissing climate change as propaganda.

2024-08-05T16:41:09Z,@N.Sniper,"Dinosaurs would laugh at people that claim the planet is overheating. Compared to the Mesozoic (Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous) it is now very very very cold. Dinosaurs lived in a climate that had moderate temperatures at the poles. Dinosaurs lived in this hot climate for 160 million years and it was this climate that allowed them to get so big. Higher temperatures means more evaporation, which means longer wet periods around the equator, warm climate also causes more CO2 (and not the other way around, as oceans emit it when warming and absorb it when cooling, but they take a long time to change temperature), which boosts plant growth. This resulted in so much plant food that herbivore Dinosaurs were able to get so enormous. Then carnivores followed. This periode not only had the largest land animals ever but also the largest flying animals ever and a sea full of giants of which the largest ichtiosaurs rival the blue whale. <br>Only in winter did temperature get below zero C degrees. Compared to the last 500 million years we live in a very cold period. We live in an ice age. However it is currently a mild period within the ice age called an inter-glacial, as opposed to the glacial where the ice comes much further. It is an ice age because there is ice at the poles, which is very unusual in the history of the earth.<br>History proves that hotter is better. Compare the biodiversity around the equator to that on the poles. Many animals are cold blooded and can&#39;t live in cold areas. But even mammals profit from warmth. The Holocene optimum was hot, which resulted in a huge explosion of the evolution of mammals. <br><br>It is possible that the current ice age we live in is ending. Currently the northern hemisphere has milder winters due to the Milankovitch cycles (changes in orbit and tilt of the planet). Apart from that there is solar activity, clouds, radiation from space, currents in oceans and atmosphere, continental drift, albedo effect and greenhouse gasses that influence the climate. Greenhouse gasses are only a portion of this and the only greenhouse gas that is actually relevant is water vapor, which is 95% of greenhouse gasses. CO2 effect is very minor. This is proven by the fact that in the past CO2 always followed climate almost a century behind temperature. It is primary plant food, and while it is a greenhouse gas, its ability as such is very low and decreases per molecule when CO2 increases.<br>Factors that due influence climate are albedo effect (how much does a certain terrain absorb of reflect heat from the sun), urban heat island and aerosols that decrease the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface.<br><br>Both the medieval warm period and Roman warm period were at least as warm as today. But even those are still cold compared to the Eemien, Holocene optimum, the Mesozoic and the Permian. <br><br>The people dying from weather has decreased 95% in the last century. The amount of area burned by forest fires have gone down (despite people setting fires) and the amount of hurricanes that reach US land is lower, the strongest tornadoes have decreased.<br><br>Read the book &quot;A Very Convenient Warming&quot; or watch the documentary: &quot;Climate the Movie: The Cold Truth&quot;, it can be watched for free on Youtube for independent scientific sources about the climate.<br><br>Unfortunatly there are many people that deny the Milankovitch cycles, solar activity, cosmic radiation, albedo, aerosols, the effect of clouds, water vapor being the most important greenhouse gas,  the effect of currents and continental drift. They claim it is only CO2. And these far left woke people call others climate deniers, whereas they themselves deny all the natural causes that changed the climate very dramatically and often much faster for 4.5 billion years.<br><br>Here in the Netherlands the last two springs were the coldest we&#39;ve had for decades.

Yes, they keep some heat in, about 20 degrees, but they block out 194 degrees for a net temperature of 174.<br>Gilbert Plass is the father of CO2 warming. His paper in 1955 THE CARBON DIOXIDE THEORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE started all this idiocy.  The first sentence of the Abstract for his papers  states:<br><br>‚ÄúThe most recent calculations of the infra-red flux in the region of the 15 micron CO2, band show that the average surface temperature of the earth increases 3.6‚Äù C if the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is doubled and decreases 3.8‚Äô C if the CO2 amount is halved, provided that no other factors change which influence the radiation balance.‚Äù<br><br>You get warming ONLY if added CO2 does not change the radiation balance, meaning the heat entering does not fall with added CO2.<br>Before satellites, all scientists worked from the assumption that the sun mostly produced visible light and little heat.  That visible light warmed the earth as the levels of CO2 and water vapor blocked out all the sun‚Äôs heat.  Adding CO2 will not block out more incoming Sun heat as the was so little coming in to to begin with.  But this is wrong.  <br><br>Heat is the majority of the sun‚Äôs radiation.  30% of the sun‚Äôs heat makes it past the atmosphere, so adding more CO2 does change the radiation balance.  Added CO2 blocks out more sun heat cooling the earth and reversing the greenhouse effect!  Which is what Plass‚Äôs paper said.  Plass assumed that added CO2 did not change the radiation balance, so added CO2 created a warmer earth, but he was wrong, added CO2 created a cooler earth. <br>250 above, only 76 degrees below.  Cooler earth hotter atmosphere.  The Troposphere is getting warmer with added CO2, not the surface.  The CO2 in the troposphere is absorbing more incoming sun heat and getting warmer.<br>We are getting warmer, but that is because the Little Ice Age (LIA), ended in 1850.  The Earth has been warming up since then.  Snow has been melting and the oceans have been warming up.   With less and less cold left over from the LIA the warming is accelerating.  We are going back to the Earth that existed in the last Inter-Glacial Period when Iceland was baren of ice and the seas were 26 feet higher than today.  <br>20,000 years ago the seas were 110 feet lower than today.  This is how it goes on the Earth, warm to cold, low seas to high seas.  This is just the first time mankind has had the education and intelligence to understand what is happening.  <br>Neanderthals lived through the last Ice Age but they didn‚Äôt know there was an ice age, it was just the way it was.  Earlier hominids had no idea that they were in an inter-glacial age.  All they knew was it was it was warm.   <br>Plass‚Äôs work is on the internet just google and read it for yourself, you only need to read the first sentence in the abstract.",0

2024-06-01T12:56:44Z,@Seabrook57,"This video is apparently more than two years old now, and the climate science has progressed significantly, along with the progressively escalating shocking effects of warming on humanity.  With the sudden catastrophic unprecedented rise (more accurately a &quot;huge jump&quot;) in global average seas-surface temperatures in 2023, the scientists who have been showing climate models that include global tipping points and changes in the aerosol masking effect have been proven correct. Continued present conditions and future global heating that&#39;s already &quot;in the pipeline&quot; already guarantee climate chaos will continue to intensify and worsen regardless of what we do today.  Rapid heating of the oceans and land/air temperatures is unfolding more exponentially than gradually, so now, in 2024, we know that reaching +3¬∫C is no longer a question, but a certainty, and the data suggests that it will likely happen much sooner than &quot;by the end of the century&quot;... like perhaps &quot;by the end of this decade&quot; is a more realistic forecast, given all the new data and the ever-changing weather that we have been experiencing since this video was made.  And sadly, the situation is and will continue to get worse and more suffering will continue to grow, as starving people (including lots of drought-stricken small farmers as was so skillfully reported in this cutting edge Forbes report). Many farms will no longer able to grow food for the world, especially small and medium-sized farms (which are the opposite of the increased reliance on eating factory-farmed pigs, cows, chickens, etc., in terms of carbon pollution) .  --- This climate-driven reduction/collapse of humanity&#39;s ability to grow and store large amounts of food (especially grains) has already started, and is combining with crashing fertility rates in many parts of the world on a path to global population decline.  Many climate refugees are already forced by worsening drought to leave their homes and lives to migrate to cities and to more northern latitudes. Meanwhile, it&#39;s a huge oversight that many climate studies still fail to consider the aerosol masking effect, which is being reduced more and more with less sulfer in marine fuels and with each coal plant closure, etc. As we burn cleaner marine fuels and  less coal, we also reduce the amount of reflective aerosols. These aerosol pollutants are harmful to breathe, but they conversely/ironically directly slow the warming caused by their counterparts: the greenhouse gasses.  When the new requirements for marine fuels kicked in, it immediately triggered a sudden increased heating effect, especially in ocean surface temperatures in heavily-trafficed shipping lanes.

The federal government isn&#39;t, however, passing legislation restricting the sale of private jets. Worldwide, no government is passing legislation against the building, purchasing, and use of superyachts, which dump an average of 500 gallons of gasoline into our oceans every hour. We will always have oil and gas. What&#39;s happening is that the elites are consolidating the use of this energy source. Let&#39;s play this game theory out further.

I wouldn&#39;t call miself a scientist, but I think that my knowledge resulting from meteorological observations for 55 years is much greater than that of an ordinary ecologist with a green clover on his chest. Well, my observations show that the reason for the increase in the average summer temperature in Europe is the excellent air purification as a result of the liquidation of coal-fired power plants, metallurgy, the widespread use of electrostatic precipitators and the widespread use of clean processes (waste incineration plants, landfills, foundry processes...) with closed air circuits and filtration. These great technological changes in the industry have caused the emission of all dust into the atmosphere to be radically smaller and decreasing. Everyone knows that dust is the nucleus of water vapor condensation, which causes the formation of fog and clouds. (By the way, who recently drove in dense fog, what was a common thing in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s). As a result, the number of cloudless days and the amount of precipitation in Europe are decreasing. And everyone who flies a plane knows that clouds seen from above are white because they perfectly reflect light, which, after being reflected from the cloud layer, escapes into space.

2024-06-19T04:32:30Z,@Susanne-qp8vj,"I don&#39;t agree with you. Clean air only explains a few phenomena. In Switzerland, temperatures have risen by a massive 2.5 degrees due to climate change. The glaciers in the Alps will have completely disappeared in a few decades. Summer sometimes starts in April with long dry periods and temperatures reach 35 degrees and more, which was unthinkable in the 1980s and 90s. 2024 represents an anomaly in this regard. We are experiencing a spring and summer like I know from my childhood. At the same time, record temperatures are being measured in southeastern Europe.",1

Climate change should be talked about in terms of 100,000 years, or maybe even millions of years. And human civilization on Earth lasts only several thousand years. Renewable energy sources can also cause climate change, because, for example, obtaining millions of MW of electricity from wind hinders the free flow of air and may cause unfavorable climate changes.",0

He wouldn&#39;t call himself a scientist, but I think that my knowledge resulting from meteorological observations for 55 years is much greater than that of an ordinary ecologist with a green clover on his chest. Well, my observations show that the reason for the increase in the average summer temperature in Europe is the excellent air purification as a result of the liquidation of coal-fired power plants, metallurgy, the widespread use of electrostatic precipitators and the widespread use of technological processes (waste incineration plants, landfills, foundry processes...) with closed air circuits and filtration. These great technological changes in the industry have caused the emission of all dust into the atmosphere to be radically smaller and decreasing. Everyone knows that dust is the nucleus of water vapor condensation, which causes the formation of fog and clouds.

2024-04-20T10:12:19Z,@Freedomisintelligence,"In 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first predicted that changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect. In 1938, Guy Callendar connected carbon dioxide increases in Earth&#39;s atmosphere to global warming. 100 years later people didn&#39;t take global warming seriously in the 1990&#39;s. 30 years later people are still not taking it seriously. Well the warnings were given over 100 years ago and nobody listened and it could of been prevented with alternative technologies. Money destroyed the planet. Is it possible that the human race did the same thing on mars and escaped to planet earth millions of years ago. If earths magnetic field shifts due to global warming then a great flood of the earth will happen then the oceans will boil off from the sun bombarding our planet from a shift in our protective field thus earth becomes mars. We need to find another home or face the same fate as mars. We can make mars habitable in a 50 year timeline and stop the earth from a global catastrophe if everyone worked together. Money is just a thing people made up and can be discarded. When it comes to the human races survival then money is irrelevant.",1

This has been blamed on human activities with a particularly keen blame on the CO2 emissions. I have a paper written that proves that IT IS NOT THE CO2 BUT WATER  that is the actual reason behind the changes. Spare 2 mins and I‚Äôll set the base line for the claim.<br><br>The climate is directly connected to the environment and therefore the changes and so for thiis I  will only be indulging in the factors that are of just the environment. The most common signs include : <br>    1. Rising sea levels<br>    2. drought<br>    3. change in weather patterns<br>    4. melting sea ice<br>    5. weaker  plants(inability to resist pests and diseases)<br>    6. rising sea temperatures<br>    7. increased frost in places that experience snowy conditions<br>    8. increased occurrence of floods<br>    9. heatwaves etc.<br>    10. drying up of rivers.<br><br>Out rightly none of the above mentioned signs have clear and close ties to carbon dioxide, instead LOOK   AT   THE   WATER   ELEMENT  ,  water is the dominant common denominator and it would imply that faults in the water system cycle would have effects to the environment  that are to be felt more  than any other factor like inert gases.<br><br>Look at the amounts available to the environment, water occupies over 2/3 of the earths surface area while carbon dioxide as an element is about 0.003% of the earths atmosphere. It also seems that if all the above issues were solved , with regards to water, a large portion of the problem would be solved.<br><br>Think of the melting ice in the frosty regions, the ice had to have been formed in some way, my paper delves into how the ice is formed and how in particular it is a last resort for the planets climate. <br><br>Is it not interesting that even though water volumes in the oceans are increasing it does not cause a general increase in the water supplied (on average) as would have been expected following the water cycle as is well known. The paper describes how the shift of water has drifted from the land to the seas.<br><br><br>As seen above I have given a general observation of the problem but, the specific element of water is hidden. I‚Äôve had a difficult time getting a publisher for my paper, no funding is available , interested parties to this paper can reach out via email  ‚Äúgathecah01@gmail.com‚Äù.",1

Not to mention the changes in plant parasites and diseases, and the destruction of crops due to more extreme weather, cold, heat, floods and wind and the requirement for more water for crop production.  (these were mentioned).  It means farmers will need more artificial fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides, (things that small farms cannot afford to do), and an increased need for water.

I further predict that the necessity for action and the wealth that these people will accumulate will force society to acknowledge ecological literacy as literacy, to acknowledge that humans are part of the ecosystem, stimulate the development of ecologically-based and ecologically-constrained technology and the creation of an ecologically-based and ecologically-constrained economy.

2024-01-02T04:25:31Z,@Harmlesspotato951,"Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth‚Äôs average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, leading to a gradual rise in temperatures.<br><br>The main contributors to global warming are:<br><br>	1.	Burning Fossil Fuels: The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy, transportation, and industrial purposes releases large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.<br>	2.	Deforestation: Trees absorb CO2, so the loss of forests contributes to increased CO2 levels as fewer trees are available to absorb the excess carbon dioxide.<br>	3.	Agricultural Activities: Livestock farming, particularly cattle and sheep, produces methane through their digestive processes. Additionally, certain agricultural practices release nitrous oxide, another potent greenhouse gas.<br><br>The consequences of global warming are far-reaching:<br><br>	1.	Rising Temperatures: Overall temperature rise affects weather patterns, leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves, storms, and extreme weather events.<br>	2.	Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels: Higher temperatures cause polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising sea levels. This threatens coastal communities and ecosystems.<br>	3.	Ocean Acidification: Increased CO2 levels also cause oceans to become more acidic, endangering marine life and coral reefs.<br>	4.	Ecosystem Disruption: Climate change disrupts ecosystems, affecting plant and animal species, potentially leading to extinction or migration of species to new areas.<br><br>Addressing global warming requires global cooperation and various mitigation strategies:<br><br>	1.	Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can significantly decrease CO2 emissions.<br>	2.	Afforestation and Reforestation: Planting trees and conserving forests helps absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.<br>	3.	Energy Efficiency: Implementing energy-efficient technologies and practices across industries and households reduces overall energy consumption and, consequently, emissions.<br>	4.	International Agreements: Global efforts such as the Paris Agreement aim to unite countries in their commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global temperature rise.<br><br>Each individual‚Äôs actions, from reducing personal energy consumption to advocating for sustainable practices, play a crucial role in combating global warming.<br><br>The scientific consensus underscores the urgency of taking immediate and collective action to mitigate the impacts of global warming and safeguard the planet for future generations.",1

2024-01-01T00:53:09Z,@HealingLifeKwikly,"&quot;Yes but climate has always changed and always will. Humans survive regardless.&quot; Actually, humans are currently warming the planet ~18 times faster than it usually warms when coming out of an ice age, and it is this rapid rate of warming which is so lethal for species, ecosystems, humans and societies. Some of us will survive, but unless we stop this rapid warming, billions will die and millions of species will go extinct. To get some sense of the problem, the last time the Earth warm this rapidly and oceans acidified this rapidly, 95% of marine life went extinct, as did 70% of life on land, including everything over 90 pounds. And THAT mass extinction event happened without the direct killing of specicies, direct destruction of ecosystems, and chemical and plastic pollution we added to the mix. So, our current trajectory isn&#39;t simply a warmer planet, it&#39;s a mass extinction event. <br><br>&quot;the number of lives lost due to global warming is minuscule compared to those lost due to cold weather.&quot; Unfortunately, sustained and rapid climate change degrades and destroys the web of life and thus kills people in far more ways than just direct heat: droughts, water shortages, intensifying climate disasters, livestock deaths, crop failures, food shortages, resource wars, and hundreds of diseases whose range is being expanded by global warming. <br><br>Quite simply, we&#39;re on track for major losses of species and humans in this century unless we change course.",1
2024-01-01T14:10:31Z,@teryd5672n,"@@HealingLifeKwikly suggest you read some informed literature. Humans have survived in much lower and higher temperatures. Even recently cf 1850‚Äôs with Roman times in the UK. Climate change is natural and our impact on it is minor. CO2 levels were over 10 times of today during the late Paleozoic era and the world was greener than ever, hence the Carboniferous period. <br><br>There is as much ice in the arctic this winter than there was decades ago. The only reason for reducing fossil fuel dependency is because of its finite nature and being located in undesirable places.",1
2024-01-06T18:45:27Z,@HealingLifeKwikly,"@@redredred8408 Thanks for your reply. First, I would rather it be 28 degrees Fahrenheit on Christmas Day and the ground covered with snow. I love a white Christmas, but I understand that some other people would prefer it be 63 degrees. Second, this issue is not about our personal pleasure, it is about what happens to the world when species and ecosystems accustomed to cooler temps and lower CO2 levels confront a rapidly warmng climate. And the answer to what happens is it causes HUNDREDS of harmful ripple effects for people, societies, species, and ecosystems. Kept up long enough, it causes mass extinctions of life, including the collapse of modern civilization and the premature death of billions of humans. Imagine 40% of livestock dying in killer heat waves and droughts and similar levels of losses of staple crops. <br><br>The reason I gave up golf is because I&#39;m a researcher who has spent thousands of hours studying why the health of ecosystems and societies are unraveling and what we must do to save them. <br><br>Think of a very long dominoes layout. We have already toppled many dominoes early in the layout but we can&#39;t yet see everything that this chain reaction will cause to topple. Why scientists are so freaked out is because they study the issues in enough depth so they can see what other dominoes are going to fall. <br><br>Take care.",1

I haven&#39;t seen any attempt to improve the accuracy of these climate change models in the last 40 years which makes me think they are not being driven by data. Surely our measurement equipment has improved over the last 40 years but the models have continued to be way higher than actual recorded global temperatures. Most scientists strive to improve the accuracy of their predictive models to make them more useful. The only possible explanation for why the climate predictive models have not become vastly more accurate over time is that there usefulness to the agenda will go down if the accuracy of the predictions improves.,1

The scientists who study Arctic environment like Greenland ice sheet, Arctic Sea ice, arctic permafrost are raising serious concern about positive feedbacks from there. Arctic is warming 3-4 times faster than the rest of the World so there the global temperature has already risen by 3-4 degrees C. The climate models doesn&#39;t take in account the CO2 and methane emissions from permafrost thawing which is already happens. So because of this 3 degrees C could easily be reached by 2050 and 9-10 degrees C by 2100. So the problem is way serious and urgent.",0

There is no uniform, universal, world-wide temperature increase. There are many places around the world that have experienced temperature decreases as other places increase. Thirdly, as has been demonstrated time and again in peer-reviewed scientific literature the effects of CO2 on the atmosphere and the climate models used to predict the effects have been greatly exaggerated. One such study demonstrates clearly how the related climate model was off by 40%.

This year, I&#39;ve been having to mow my lawn weekly since the beginning of September, when the ground should not be warm enough to sustain such growth well into October. We get more extreme weather events and cyclones travel further south from the tropics, in part due to weaker jetstreams as a result of warming, and they stay wetter and stronger due to warmer oceans surrounding us. The Tasman sea has been breaking record warm levels year on year in recent times.

Every year $39.5 billion of direct government expenditure every single year. The figures are based on the 2017 Indigenous Expenditure Report produced by the Productivity Commission. Issues of racial and social injustices are hardly ousted by elevating and heightening race (cultural identification, credentials). Especially on a political level, but also within the wider community. The Voice to Parliament is all about adding a new ‚ÄúElite Canberra-based bureaucracy‚Äù in the constitution rather than reconciliation or recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Australia has over 270 cultures, let‚Äôs embrace them all, but most importantly let‚Äôs embrace the Australians who make up our country first. The individual, and not limit Australians as only their cultural identification, credentials. It began with a separate flag, (Hardly a unifying symbol. Oh you guys aren&#39;t Australian?).

All to serve the self seeking, selfish interests of a very small militant, embittered and clearly corrupt organisation. This small ‚Äòelite‚Äô group has garnered incredible levels of power, and influence thanks to some very clever, and less than honest use of any available manipulation available to them, especially the weaponization of race. For decades our schools and Australian society in general has attacked, shamed and reviled our European heritage, while conversely literally inventing, exaggerating, and simply fantasising over Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ‚Äòculture‚Äô. The Voice is not a path to reconciliation, and harmony it is a path to entrench structural racism within our nation&#39;s constitution. Something that should be abhorrent to all Australians but particularly so to Indigenous Aboriginal, and Torres Strait Islander‚Äôs. So please Greens, and The ALP don‚Äôt lecture and moralise any Australian on our tolerance, open-mindedness, or our almost universal acceptance of the Aboriginal people. The Voice is fluff, popular, crowd-pleasing, and overt virtue signalling, encouraging intolerance, narrow-mindedness, and dogmatism. Yet beyond this reality. The Voice is another expensive misuse of money that could and indeed should be actually being used to improve the lives of Australians. And perhaps even used to improve the lives of all Australians in need, without any thought to their race? Or their cultural background! Victimhood culture has taken over the Australian political landscape. Victimhood culture is another technique in obtaining power, and silencing opposition.

If emissions are still rising and might only peak by 2030, keep in mind the world will continue hearing for decades to come, because the emissions we do now heat the world later.

Any ideas? Anyone?<br>BTW.<br>The worlds Nuclear weapons nations have tested about 2100 nuclear weapons around the world since 1945. Realize that these are the nations complaining about Global warming. Some of those weapons were set off high above the earth in the upper atmosphere and some were set off underground, under water,  or on islands out in the oceans, and a couple were set off above populated cities. A couple of Nuclear power plants have suffered catastrophic meltdowns. So the question is, how much damage has been done to this worlds global temperatures LONG TERM as a result of these tests? What role has all of these tests played into the Global warming effects that we are being told is caused by our use of oil products? Products that are used to make so many other products that we all use everyday. When you set off nuclear blasts at the edge of space with no clue what the consequences of those actions might be, then you really can&#39;t predict or know what amount of LONG TERM damage is yet to come from those decisions.<br>How many ships are sitting at the bottom of the worlds oceans slowly leaking their cargo onto the unsuspecting and very delicate ecosystems of the oceans? How many ships have been deliberately sank in the oceans due to war among nations? What efforts have been taken to recover those ships leaking and polluting cargo? Conservatively a thousand shipping containers fall from ships decks every year due to storms and other problems. Guess where those loaded containers end up? Oil based products make up an estimated 6000 products that we use everyday. Look it up. The problems that we are facing can not be solved by governments and globalists who blame us for using the products that THEY got rich making. Products that THEY will continue to enjoy long after THEY take away our way of life. Protecting the earth has to be done in a peaceful give and take way that&#39;s shared by everyone, but this will never happen if war mongering, control freak, greedy politicians and their elitist donors are running the show.

It has risen by an astounding 5 degrees to 40.2C in just 4 years, and every single year since covid has given us temperatures higher than the previous highest recorded temperature. I would also like to point out that this highest temperature ever was on a freak day on 1990 some 33 years ago and outside of that one day, the second highest recorded temperature was 32.9 degrees. Peak temperature is a solid EIGHT POINT 3 DEGREES warmer than just 4 years ago. <br><br>You can see just in the weather patterns alone just how much the climate has shifted radically in just those few years alone, the UK is entering into a climate of monsoon summers which is absurd for a country that has never experienced summer with many days over 25 degrees. Our society is not built to cope with the heat or the humidity that comes with such rises in temperature, and the short term fixes that we use to try to curb our ever sweltering living conditions are notorious for contributing seriously towards greenhouse gas emissions themselves this exacerbating  the problem we try to fix even further. <br><br>While it is very apparent that climate change has come home to roost even at home, it is nothing compared to entire countries that will be underwater if global temperature rise by another degree. It is almost definitely too late to save the inevitable slide into disaster we have set course on, melting ice sheets mean rising water levels and less heat reflection from the surface causing more melting.

In addition co2 is the only way man can conceivably affect the climate and yet c02 levels were much higher in the past during cooling periods. To be honest, based on these 2 points, I believe climate measurement has been faulty over the last 50 plus years. With the expansion of cities in the last 100 years, more measurements are being taken in urban areas, which will skew the measurements higher than what they should be.

Others said that eruption caused rain not to fall over land. So what does everybody think are we there yet? Are those lines geo eng. or what? Caldeira prior to now working for dear little Bill since Jan 2021, he worked for the govt on how to efficiently spray and spread pathogens in geoengineering sprays. When did the drought start getting super bad? ANNNNDDDD not to leave out...check out the patent office at last count 167 patents under weather modification (control, war fare). All you have to do to know they are lI ing thru their teeth is hold up your thumb or four fingers to the sun. Notice the haze around it besides never having that in broad daylight the silvery, pearlized kind anyhow. Smog is brown and any water based mist is opague. Out here in CA where we get NO rain it is like that every day. The silvery, pearlized haze 1-2 feet from the edge of the sun. It used to be clear air all the way to the edge of it when I was a kid. See Geo engine ering watch. RFK and Organic consumers Association have been talking about g/e. OCA&#39;s newsletter has two lengthy articles and two links under addtl reading for more.",1

So yes, westerners use more fossil fuels but the less developed countries make up for it in population and more and more they want what westerners do. They have food and drink in plastic containers. The clothing and bazaars have brightly colored clothing; the fashion and clotheing industry is a high polluter.

2023-09-14T20:47:24Z,@yes12337,No. Heatwaves will not be the only consequence for Europe. This will be the least severe result and much more devastating will be extreme (flash) floods interchanged with catastrophic droughts and very unusual temperature/weather anomalies caused by disrupted jet streams. Also the rough weather will cause farmers to quit their jobs and the food prices will skyrocket. This in return will trigger multiple military conflicts throughout the world and mass migration (way before actual people displacement caused by climate change itself). Also many countries rely on nuclear power plants located on the seacoast or near other bodies of water on which they rely. Both the sea and sweetwater will become a danger to the facilities. But imo the worst consequence could be a civil war(s) caused by the crisis in Europe and other countries,2

First, what happens 20,000 years from now isn&#39;t the problem since humans are pushing ecosystems and societies towards worsening collapse in THIS century, and unless we shrink global GDP by about 50%, Earth will keep getting hotter and for various reasons, the ecosystems that support all life on Earth will keep breaking down.

2023-09-12T04:46:47Z,@HealingLifeKwikly,"Sorry, but climate scientists have accounted for all the natrual cycles. There is OVERWHELMING scientific evidence that a) humans caused ~98% of the net global warming since 1850, b) man-made global warming is causing profound climate disruption all over the world (including increasingly-intense heat waves, droughts, and wildfires), and c) the heat and climate disruption is stressing Earth‚Äôs species and ecosystems and causing them to steadily break down/die off. Attribution science has found that many recent heat waves were made anywhere from 3 times more likely to 100 times more likely by man-made global warming, and scientists rated the heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest of the US and Southwest of Canada as being flatly impossible without man-made global warming. <br><br>Due to the hotter and drier conditions caused by man-made global warming, we have pushed the Earth into a ‚Äúglobal browning‚Äù trend for the last 22 years, a trend that will only get worse unless we end CO2 emissions and start putting carbon back into the ground. Simply Google ‚ÄúScientific American, the earth stopped getting greener 20 years ago.‚Äù <br><br>The 6th IPCC Report was the most thoroughly researched scientific report in human history. It was written by hundreds of leading climate scientists from all over the world, vetted by thousands of other leading scientists from all over the world, backed by over 6,000 research citations, and every line of its conclusions was signed off on/agreed to by every single nation on Earth. The scientific evidence proving that humans are warming the planet is rock solid. You can read for free the three reports that make up the 6th IPCC cycle by simply googling them. It states that humans caused ALL recent global warming. <br><br>All the major predictions of the theory of man-made global warming that could have come true by now have come true, and 14 different climate models, some dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, have accurately predicted how much our emissions would warm the planet. Heck, even Exxon‚Äôs own scientists had a climate model back in the 1980s that predicted how much our emissions would warm the planet with decent accuracy, so they wrote an internal memo to their bosses at Exxon warning them about what continuing to burn fossil fuels would do to the planet. So, their bosses closed down that scientific unit, didn‚Äôt warn the public, and instead, for the last four decades, have been funded climate denial misinformation just like what you are saying to me here. It was expensive, but they got people like you to repeat ideas that we know are patently false. <br><br>Just Google ‚ÄúCBS News climate models have been impressively accurate for decades‚Äù for coverage of the research proving the second point. The research that this article discusses is linked in the article, so you can go read it for yourself.",1

And we have made atmospheric CO2 levels the highest they have been in about 1 million years and global temps the highest they have been since ~125,000 years ago. <br><br>&quot;It will literally change everything about our planet to upset this natural cycle.&quot; As I just noted, we have already upset the cycle--the natural cycle would be slight cooling right now. Every time you burn a gallon of gasoline in your car or truck, you add 19 pounds of CO2 to the atmosphere, and it stays there for a century or more, where it and everyone else&#39;s emissions cause a tiny bit of additional warming. That warming in turn causes the release of more methane and the evaporation of more water from the surface of the Earth. The additional methane and water vapor cause more warming and thus more CO2, methane, and water vapor to be released, and the process snowballs onward.",1

So you get partial credit.   Now here&#39;s the thing, you got nothing out of high school science.   Your writers should repeat high school.   It impossible for noncondensing greenhouse gases to change earth&#39;s greenhouse effect that adds 10¬∞F (5.55¬∞C) to earth&#39;s average temperature taking place within 20 meters of the earth&#39;s surface because earth&#39;s greenhouse effect is always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor.   After 20 meters from the surface all the radiant greenhouse energy has been absorbed by greenhouse gases.  It&#39;s further heat transfer is by convection i.e. gas molecules  bumping into each other.   In general global warming can be stated to have been stalled at 1¬∞C for thirty years prior to the present 2023.<br><br>The United Nation&#39;s IPCC science report makes it clear it is not discussing active greenhouse gas behavior or earth&#39;s greenhouse effect when in the back of a 200 page report it declares it took its greenhouse gas samples at 20 THOUSAND meters altitude and only at that one altitude!  This is a legal back stop to protect the instigators from prosecution of criminal fraud.   It can be argued a reasonably high school educated person would know better than to accept the report as being relevant to global warming caused by greenhouse gases because by only sampling greenhouse gases at 20,000 meters altitude the report has made it transparent it is not discussing active greenhouse gas behavior or earth&#39;s greenhouse effect.<br><br>Such legal back stops are common when misrepresenting products through vague wordings.   Such items as a beverage labeled &quot;All Natural Fruit Drink Flavor&quot; might be discovered when reading the ingredients to have a statement &quot;contains no actual fruit juice&quot;.  ¬† Other IPCC wordings on global warming are non scientific and can be argued are simply the opinion of people misreading its own reports.  <br><br>The IPCC science report never makes the flat out claim noncondensing greenhouse gases are causing global warming.   A key vagueness in the IPCC science report is it includes many CO2e&#39;s for greenhouse gas except the only one that maters for earth&#39;s greenhouse effect water vapor with an CO2e of 18.  Far too much life effort has been utterly waisted on such an obvious scam as carbon dioxide is causing global warming that the United Nation&#39;s IPCC has been instrumental in promoting.<br><br>Noncondensing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide can have a share in the greenhouse effect, but they can not change the overall greenhouse effect because it is always in saturation due to the strong greenhouse gas water vapor.  At 1% average tropospheric water vapor 99-1/2% of earth&#39;s greenhouse effect is due to the strong greenhouse gas water vapor.",1

The scientist who designed them have consciously chosen to omit data related to positive feed backs such as thawing permafrost releasing enormous quantities of methane. They have also omitted data from the paleoclimate record. <br><br>This is why we continue to see effects from climate change that are decades early relative to what the models predicted. James Hansen, one of the leading physicists in this field, has projected a minimum of 4C by 2100 and up to 10c and, that&#39;s just based on what we&#39;ve already added to atmosphere, assuming we stopped burning fossil fuel immediately (impossible).<br><br>Net-zero is a lie as well. It relies on technology that doesn&#39;t exist, is less effective than assumed or, requires vastly more resources than we can produce.

This is because they were never more than smoke and mirrors. <br><br>It is physiologically impossible for humans to survive at +5c and, our civilization will likely collapse well before then.  While it may still theoretically be possible to save some fraction of humanity, given the political and economic landscape, and the short comings of human nature, it is practically impossible.<br><br>As bad as things are right now, remember they are going to get much much worse up to and including the collapse of civilization and our eventual extinction.

2023-09-05T07:30:18Z,@Washpenrebel,@@beowulf2772 you do know tree rings are also used. Now here&#39;s the problem. The famous hockey stick graph used by all the politicians.

2023-09-08T14:00:23Z,@againstviralmisinformation510,"@@Washpenrebel according the journal called science, if we gather all the data we have on earth‚Äôs temperature going back at least 500 million years, we see the temperature has been much higher than today but at the last part of the graph we see an unusual spike in what seemed to be decreasing temperatures in the last few million years. We are actually just a few degrees C away, from having temperatures that has no polar ice caps in the poles. If we zoom in and look at data the past 500,000 years we notice a trend of ice ages and interglacial periods. Overall we saw the temperature decreasing until the Industrial Revolution when we see an unusual spike. I am not sure who told you that when using other data we see that there is cooling.",0

That however doesn&#39;t mean that there were heat waves back then. <br>Secondly, modern &quot;green&quot;(who are actually are just commies/socialists in disguise) never offer solutions that actually would work, even if we have them already. The thing is, solar panels are just not an effective energy source because their EROI is very low(which means they barely create enough energy to even offset energy spent on their manufacturing) and wind generators can produce energy only when wind blows(and if installed on land, they dry the soil behind them). All we need to do is to build nuclear reactors, it is cheap(if we build enough of them), scalable source of energy that produces no CO2, doesn&#39;t require rare minerals and does not pollute environment with heavy metals.

The more GHG that are emitted, the lesser the GHG effect on temperature. If CO2 was roughly 280ppm before the Industrial Revolution, and it&#39;s now roughly 410ppm (130ppm increase), and that&#39;s caused a 1.0C degree increase in temperature, then humans would have to double that amount (increase the PPM by 260) in order to get the same 1.0C increase in temperature. After that, humans would have to double that amount (520ppm increase) to get another 1.0C increase.<br>You see where this is going? It&#39;s effectively impossible for humanity to add that much GHG to the atmosphere. We&#39;re already at 8bn people, technologies are becoming fuel efficient, and other tech is being utilized to generate energy.<br>Keep in mind the earth is greening, which means plant life is growing, which means there&#39;s more plant life to pull CO2 from the atmosphere.<br>This video plays on people&#39;s fears by presenting poor connections, and what-ifs its way to conclusions.",0

2023-08-02T13:01:19Z,@stefanmetzeler,"&quot;Climate change&quot; was &quot;discussed&quot; since the late 1960s. In fact, the Club of Rome - a bunch of bored rich people - decided that they wanted a world government and that they needed something to &quot;unite humanity&quot;. They fell back on the oldest scam used by every cult and religion: threatening people with &quot;bad weather&quot;. As the planet was COOLING, since 1943, they decided to fearmonger about &quot;man-made global cooling&quot; and a &quot;coming new ice age&quot;. Absolutely everyone participated - the UN, the NOAA, all the scientific publications and mainstream media. The Guardian in 1974: &quot;A new ice age is coming fast, based on satellite data&quot; etc.<br>I know, I lived through it. They flipped to GLOBAL WARMING when the natural temperature trend changed in the 1980s. That&#39;s when I studied physics. Reading Hansen&#39;s &quot;predictions&quot; was really amusing. Among physicists, we joked that their BS was &quot;not even wrong&quot;. They never formulated a scientific, testable hypothesis. If you don&#39;t have a clearly defined hypothesis, you cannot prove it wrong. Which means it cannot confirm it, either.<br>Their models have been continuously wrong. Look up the &quot;warming pause&quot; or &quot;hiatus&quot; the IPCC worried about in 2013 - no warming since 1999! <br>They have been altering the data record to make it look like there was continuous warming. Go to NASA&#39;s GISS database - take the record for Reykjavik. You&#39;ll see that they &quot;adjusted&quot; the measured heat record of 1940 to a near-record cold. You can see it in the chart, as you can view the measured, adjusted and homogenized data. That&#39;s a complete FRAUD. They did this to thousands of records - ALWAYS cooling the past, warming recent data.<br>What does that tell you?<br>Ah yes - the WEF partnered with the Club of Rome in 1973. It&#39;s in their own book about the WEF history and Klaus Schwab bragged about it, recently. They signed a partnership agreement with the UN, in 2019, to implement the UN Agenda 2030. Now, as outcome of the COP27 meeting,  they want to steal $1000 billion from developed countries to give them to unaccountable 3rd world dictatorships (with epic kickbacks, obviously). No explanation on how that will make the weather better...<br>But the World Government progresses - they even have their own channel on YouTube, &quot;World Government Summit&quot;.",0

Global warming has been seized upon as the cause of basically every problem we face as a red herring to keep us distracted from the things that are really destroying the world right now.  Overpopulation has driven people to build on coasts, in flood plains, in forests prone to burning, in deserts without water, in all sorts of places large percentages of population didn&#39;t live before.  Overpopulation has depleted resources everywhere leading to starvation, lack of water, migration, wars.  Global warming wasn&#39;t behind the massive drop in the amount of fish harvested from the ocean and when places like America implemented tighter regulation on harvests and fishing methods the fish numbers rapidly came back.  Wealth has concentrated into so few people and with the AI software that will be here in just a few years there will be no resources to maintain civilization.  Farmland is being sold for warehouses and then water is being pumped into the desert to grow food.  A huge chunk of America&#39;s agriculture is corn for ethanol (which generates no energy, just more money and pollution, depletes water and degrades farmland) and that is what drains our rivers and aquifers - Not global warming.  Golf courses for the rich are deemed essential but water for people in low income areas is not.  The bees are dying (along with other insects) but global warming is blamed and not the chemicals we dump on agriculture and the pollution we release everywhere.<br><br>Concentration of wealth and overpopulation (with the environmental destruction that comes with that) will have killed off civilization a century before global warming starts becoming a serious problem.  We ignored the big two problems facing human civilization and now the ultra rich profiting from our two big problems are probably too powerful to stop and we are almost out of time.  Even if we are lucky and avoid WW3 I don&#39;t think civilization has more than 7 years before it falling apart gets commonly recognized as civilization itself falling apart.

2023-07-26T00:16:01Z,@sterlinglewis5700,"In view of the number of posts citing &quot;Global Cooling in the 60s and 70s&quot;, a Google search yielded this from the Guardian 13 Apr 2017: <br>&quot;An examination of peer-reviewed scientific literature conducted by a group of researchers in 2008, covering the mid-1960s through the 1970s, revealed that papers warning of global warming outnumbered those projecting cooling by a factor of six. So climate change in the form of global warming was a widespread topic of concern during this era, and there was no consensus that the Earth would cool in the immediate future.&quot;<br><br>And more: &quot;In this light, the Newsweek article of 1975 is a fascinating and meaningful artifact of a scientific era of the past. True, making fun of wrong predictions is easy and amusing. For journalists, it‚Äôs often humbling to revisit old work, especially stories more than 40 years old. But in recent years Peter Gwynne mustered the courage to look again at ‚ÄúThe Cooling World.‚Äù Writing in Inside Science Minds, an independent editorial publication of the American Institute of Physics in 2014, he explained how he produced the 1975 article.<br><br>‚ÄúWhile the hypotheses described in that original story seemed right at the time,‚Äù Gwynne explained, ‚Äúclimate scientists now know that they were seriously incomplete. Our climate is warming ‚Äî not cooling, as the original story suggested.‚Äù Put simply, he said, climate science evolved and advanced, resulting in new knowledge.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Everyone makes mistakes, science writers being no exception, but Gwynne confessed to feeling most embarrassed by climate change deniers‚Äô strange embrace of his article. For instance, U.S. Senator James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, quoted a 1974 Time Magazine article that asked ‚ÄòIs Another Ice Age Coming?‚Äô on the floor of the Senate in 2015 while speaking against climate change ‚Äî just after holding up a snowball as evidence that it still gets cold outside. Nine years earlier, Newsweek felt it necessary to publish an explanation of the story‚Äôs poor prognostications. ‚ÄúI fear that my obituary will be dominated by that single article in Newsweek,‚Äù Gwynne wrote.",1

2023-07-17T00:53:05Z,@BIGBUGBIGBUGBIGBUG,"Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in combating climate change by offering innovative solutions to regulate temperatures and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Here are some examples of AI solutions that can help regulate temperatures in relation to the issue of global warming:<br><br>Forecasting and management of renewable energies: AI can be used to predict the production of renewable energies such as solar and wind energy, which are inherently intermittent. By using machine learning models, forecasts can be improved, enabling better integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This helps balance the supply and demand of electricity, contributing to the regularization of energy consumption.<br><br>Optimization of energy consumption: AI can analyze energy consumption patterns in buildings, industries, and cities. By identifying energy inefficiencies, AI can recommend adjustments to reduce energy consumption, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity production.<br><br>Smart agriculture: AI can monitor and predict agricultural conditions, such as periods of drought or flooding. By identifying optimal times for planting, irrigating, or harvesting, farmers can better manage their crops to maintain yields while avoiding excessive water and resource use, helping regulate agricultural ecosystems and mitigate the impact of climate change.<br><br>Advanced climate modeling: AI can improve the accuracy of climate models by incorporating a larger amount of data and optimizing model parameters. More accurate climate models help better understand long-term climate trends and identify high-risk areas for adaptation measures.<br><br>Monitoring and prevention of natural disasters: AI can help monitor extreme weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods. By analyzing real-time data, AI can more accurately predict hurricane trajectories or estimate the potential damage caused by a natural disaster. This enables better preparedness, strengthens infrastructure resilience, and saves lives.<br><br>Intelligent transportation: AI can contribute to improving transport efficiency by optimizing routes, promoting public transportation, and facilitating the adoption of autonomous electric vehicles. More efficient mobility helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.<br><br>These examples demonstrate how the judicious use of artificial intelligence can contribute to regulating temperatures in the fight against climate change. However, it is essential to note that AI is not a singular solution to the problem of climate change but rather a powerful tool to combine with other efforts, such as adopting effective climate policies and engaging society in the transition to a sustainable economy.",0

2023-07-16T19:49:16Z,@JoeyBlogs007,"Based on the annual report from NOAA‚Äôs Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 417.06 parts per million (‚Äúppm‚Äù for short) in 2022, setting a new record high. The increase between 2021 and 2022 was 2.13 ppm‚Äîthe 11th year in a row where the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by more than 2 ppm.   More CO2 leads to higher temperatures. These are well established scientific principles. Green house gases allow short wavelength radiation ( visible light ) from the Sun to pass through to Earth, but when it gets absorbed by Earth,  it&#39;s reflected back out as longer wave radiation ( thermal infrared ) and gets absorbed by the greenhouse gases,  that re-emit this energy in all directions,  some is emitted back towards Earth.

2023-07-16T19:49:48Z,@JoeyBlogs007,"In general, warmer water has a reduced capacity to absorb or dissolve oxygen into the water, compared to colder water. Hence less dissolved oxygen available for fish, as the river water warms.  Dissolved oxygen is free-floating O2 molecules ( that fish require ) that gets absorbed by water at varied rates, that are subject to water temperature and other factors.  As water temperature rises, the kinetic energy of water molecules increases, leading to more rapid molecular movement. This increased molecular motion can enhance the process of gas exchange at the air-water interface. As a result, there can be a greater transfer of dissolved oxygen from the water to the surrounding atmosphere, meaning less available oxygen in the water for fish to breathe.",1

That said, there are a lot of people who actually do care for others. However, globalization makes it very hard to care for everyone and so some people stop caring about others at all as a protective mechanism for themselves. The size of this problem also makes it very hard to grasp for the average Joe. It&#39;s easy to understand what it means when your local village gets flooded, and you can personally help in this case. A drought that affects a whole continent, that you are not even living on, is much harder to grasp and even harder to do something about as an individual.",1

The plant will eventually use all of the CO2 present, photosynthesis will stop and the plant will die.<br><br>With no other limiting factors such as heat, light and nutrients the plants will photosynthesize at a rate consistent with ambient conditions (i.e. outside of the greenhouse). There may be a slight increase in photosynthetic efficiency due to the higher than ambient CO2 level, however this increase will probably be insignificant.

Because of ocean currents and Miami&#39;s location, sea levels are rising in and around the city and Miami Beach faster than in most of the world.<br><br>The second problem facing South Florida is a vexing geological one. ‚ÄúOur underlying geology is like Swiss cheese,‚Äù said Obeysekera.<br><br>The solid ground under South Florida ‚Äî Miami, Miami Beach, the Keys, and much of the rest of the peninsula ‚Äî is mostly limestone made of compressed ancient reefs that are full of tiny holes. That means salty water is rising up through the ground itself, not just in the waters surrounding Florida.<br><br>&quot;Our underlying geology is like Swiss cheese.&quot;<br>Jayantha Obeysekera, scientist with the South Florida Water Management District<br>The water could start intruding on drinking-water reservoirs (it already has in some areas) and killing off non-salt-tolerant vegetation, including shade-providing palm trees. It‚Äôs impossible to wall South Florida‚Äôs water out with levees or giant gates ‚Äî as other cities have done ‚Äî if the water rises up through the ground.

2023-01-31T01:30:09Z,@christopherdetter893,"I see no doubt that climate change is real and very little doubt that it is associated human activity. As I set my thermostat, it dawned on me that I don&#39;t know if the obvious contribution of building heat has been considered, and how it compares to the effect of greenhouse gases like CO2. The contribution of building heat is obviously huge (think of the forests of skyscrapers in large cities), and its steep contribution would correspond to the turn of the 19th century (as would the greenhouse effect). Building heat contribution is obviously NOT an essentially thermodynamically--neutral phenomenon like air conditioning. The need to heat indoors in winter exists in huge swaths of landed areas, mostly in the northern hemisphere. Insulation slows the rate of heat dissipation and reduces the total amount of heat needed, but it does not eliminate heat loss entirely. I&#39;m not an expert and may have missed coverage of this aspect of climate change, but nowhere have I heard of any scientific investigation comparing heat added by greenhouse gas effects vs heat added by the sum of all indoor space heating - a heretofore glaring oversight. Even if we manage to eliminate all artificial discharge of CO2 into the atmosphere, would we really slow down climate change? By how much? Would it be better to invest money in better insulation systems?",0

It eventually become too much and the earth like a earthquake will make it extremely cold aka ice age. That‚Äôs why people say its not real bc they think the world will turn warmer when in reality its turning colder because it‚Äôs turning warmer. Another thing is water or anything warm in general turns cold over time so what do you think all that warm energy turns into? More warm energy? Theoretically you would assume it makes it endlessly stay warm like adding wood to a fire or leaving a stove on but since the world has nights the coldness of the night might help cool it too making some of the warm energy turn to cool energy.,0

We need to stop eating meat and let the numbers of animals decrease right down (which they will - they are only so high now because they have been forcefully bred into existence). This would free up land which would re-wild back to forest to absorb the heating gases and water and give space for wild animals to live and thus balance out the eco-systems. Animal agriculture is responsible for 80% of global warming when you factor in the forest cleared to accommodate grazing livestock. We don&#39;t need meat to thrive.

Unfortunately, the small number of predictions of an ice age appeared to be much more interesting than those of global warming, so it was those sensational &#39;Ice Age&#39; stories in the press that so many people tend to remember.  The fact is that around 1970 there were 6 times as many scientists predicting a warming rather than a cooling planet.

The CO2 output can be offset by the amount of trees using them to convert them back to O2 and is more controllable.  1) Other lesser controllable options are forest fires to send soots into the atmospher to deflection heat back into space, 2) more technological idea is to have someone like Elon Musk send more space &quot;mirrors&quot; or extendable fabric of 2-3 km in length at higher orbits above our belt of space trash to reduce heat absorption on Earth in a few vital regions of agriculture, 3) not the best option since it may trigger alot of other ecological problems around the volcano area, but induce or by nature a volcano with sufficient force such as the Krakota Eruption that can reduce global temperature by 3 degree Celsius for a few years to decrease the damages done by constant rising temperatures.",0

If we stopped driving flying all vehicles we would still be on course for 2-3 degrees higher temperatures. If we stopped animal farming now we would reduce the chance of climate breakdown far quicker. If only everyone knew this. But meat and dairy are deeply embedded into cultures and are highly addictive so people will naturally turn a cheek. If you genuinely care about your childrens future stop consuming animal products. Push for change by using what these industries rely on.. your money! If you don‚Äôt accept this please go do some very long and thought out research.

Klaus &quot;You Will Own Nothing and Be Happy&quot; Schwab of the infamous WEF is shoving it into our faces every chance he gets. Who among you believe Greta-How Dare You- &quot;Thunderpants&quot; of the Global Warming B.S. ? This mind-controlled kid cannot, without the aid of a prepared speech, string together words to come up with a coherent sentence. She is joined by the darling of ADL, (another misrepresented, putting it mildly, organization) &quot;Ahnold&quot;-You Have No Right to Refuse the Death Jab- Schwarzenneger. The new moniker is Climate Change since no one was buying Global Warming which is actually CYCLICAL (Caps for emphasis). Dr. Leslie Woodcock, emeritus professor at the University of Manchester (UK) School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, is a former NASA scientist along with other impressive accomplishments on his distinguished professional resume. In an interview, he laughed off man-made climate change as nonsense and a money-making industry for the green lobby, which approaches the subject with a religious fervor. Explained Woodcock:<br><br>&quot;The term &#39;climate change&#39; is meaningless. The Earth&#39;s climate has been changing since time immemorial, that is since the Earth was formed 1,000 million years ago. The theory of &#39;man-made climate change&#39; is an unsubstantiated hypothesis [about] our climate [which says it] has been adversely affected by the burning of fossil fuels in the last 100 years, causing the average temperature on the earth&#39;s surface to increase very slightly but with disastrous environmental consequences. The theory is that the CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuel is the &#39;greenhouse gas&#39; causes &#39;global warming&#39; ‚Äî in fact, water is a much more powerful greenhouse gas and there is 20 time more of it in our atmosphere (around one per cent of the atmosphere) whereas CO2 is only 0.04 per cent. There is no reproducible scientific evidence CO2 has significantly increased in the last 100 years. Anecdotal evidence doesn&#39;t mean anything in science, it&#39;s not significant‚Ä¶&quot;. <br><br>It needs repeating, mainstream media is propaganda. The CIA runs MSM. Research Edward Bernays if you don&#39;t understand what propaganda is. Research and think for yourself. Stop waiting to get spoon-fed. 80% of our high school graduates are functional illiterates. If you can read, educate the illiterates or we will all be cannon fodder of the NWO. Yeah, that thing you stupidly believe to be a conspiracy theory.",2

One example is fire and melting.  It gets hotter.  So you have more forest fires (CO2) and permafrost melt (Methane).  That release make it hotter.  So you have even more forest fires and permafrost melting.  Which makes it even hotter.  And so on.  The process of climate change acceleration due to these feedback loops means it will not take as long to get to 3C as many believe right now.,8

The IPCC has various scenarios for different temperature increases depending on the amount of CO2 emitted, the worst being the notorious &#39;RCP 8.5&#39; which alarmists frequently use. The IPCC now admits that RCP 8.5 is now very unlikely to happen. CO2 levels may never rise sufficiently to get an increase of 3 degrees. Remember that the rise in temperature is a constant (equilibrium climate sensitivity, ECS) for a doubling of CO2 &amp; if we assume this constant is say 2 degrees per doubling, with CO2  now at 420 parts per million it would have to rise to 840 parts per million to raise the temperature of the planet by just 2 degrees, (not three!). Scientists don&#39;t even agree on what the actual value of the ECS is &amp; different models use different values &amp; furthermore each value is the mean of a spread of values!

NO! And the reason is very simple. That is the period of the dinosaurs. Dinosaur fossils have been found at the North Pole. Palm tree fossils have been found at the North Pole.<br>Big deal you say.

And NO it is not because we are reducing emissions due to renewables etc as we are actually &quot;INCREASING&quot; emissions each and every year.<br>How is it that the projected temp increase is falling yet the year it is predicted to occur in is increasing if the levels of carbon emitted is increasing faster than at any other time since records have been kept?<br>NOTHING they say adds up.

2022-07-21T13:20:13Z,@ronibark5804,"The current heatwave in Europe is scorching the land and killing its residents. So far, according to ABC News and other sources, ‚ÄúThere have also been more than 1,000 heat-related deaths in Spain and Portugal‚Äù alone, not counting the death toll in France, Italy, and more is coming as the heatwave moves toward the UK. Worse yet, we are only in the middle of July; there is plenty of time for more heatwaves to come. According to scientists, unless we curb emission of greenhouse gases, heatwaves will grow even hotter and more frequent. They may, or they may not, but either way, we are the ones who determine what happens.<br>We need to understand that being at the top of the pyramid of creation means that everything we do trickles down the structure, from top to bottom. When it reaches the bottom, the inanimate level of reality, from which everything grows, it changes it. If we ooze ill-will, it creates negative changes throughout the system, which manifest in increasingly extreme climatic and geological events.<br>In other words, when human relationships go out of balance, everything goes out of balance. When our relations become extreme, everything becomes extreme; when we become violent, everything becomes violent. Each summer, the ramifications of the linkage between our relations and our world become more extreme, until we acknowledge that everything that exists, exists in a connected, hierarchical system and that whoever is at the top determines the state of the rest of the system.<br>It is not as if previously, we were better people than we are today. It is simply that there were fewer people, and therefore fewer elements that exude ill will.<br>Also, relationships between people in the past were less toxic than they are today. While there are fewer wars today than ever, the levels of suspicion and alienation between people are skyrocketing, to the point where people can no longer trust their own family members. As a result, wars between countries are rarer than ever, but divorce rates, domestic violence, and violence in the community, are at an all-time high.<br>Even the internet, which we invented purportedly in order to connect people, is being used to abuse, deceive, and exploit people. The world-wide-web proves that everything we create, we use against others. When there is such a negative element in a system, and that element is at the top of the system, how can the entire system not go awry?<br>Therefore, if we want the weather to cool, the sea-level to drop, and the storms to subside, we must cool the fire and calm the storms between us. Mutual concern, mutual responsibility, or at least the knowledge that we are dependent on each other, are necessary in order to restore balance in our world at all levels, from the ground we walk on to the hatred in our hearts..",0

Well above-normal temperatures during most of June became exceptionally hot for the last week of the month as surface high pressure developed across Florida and upper level high pressure centered itself overhead.  All-time high temperatures were recorded in a number of locations including Wilmington, NC where the temperature hit 104 degrees on June 27th, 1952, a record that still stands today.  New Bern, NC reached 106 degrees on July 22, 1952, setting not just their all-time record high temperature but also their all-time highest daily average temperature of 93.5 degrees. (The morning low was a sticky 81 degrees)<br><br>High temperatures were only in the 80s and lower 90s for the first half of July, but the heat wave came roaring back on July 18th.  In Florence and Columbia, SC 100+ degree temperatures occurred on 8 out of 11 days from July 20th through July 30th.  New Bern, NC recorded its all-time record high temperature of 106 on July 22th, and Hickory, NC set its all-time record high of 105 on July 29th.  At least six deaths were blamed on the heat, and agricultural losses to the tobacco crop in North Carolina alone may have approached $10 million.  The impact this heat wave had on the people living here is magnified by the fact that very few homes had air conditioning in 1952.<br><br>Other all-time record highs established during this event include 103 in Southport, NC; 104 in Winston-Salem, NC; 106 in Marion, NC; 108 in Cheraw, SC; and 109 in Bamberg, SC.  Charlotte, NC&#39;s morning low of 79 degrees on June 27th is still the warmest low temperature on record for the Queen City.",0

We can see that all over the world particularly with distance from these Northern Hemisphere Comet strikes that there is clear evidence of Pyramid Building and the earliest Pyramids were build by Dark Skinned People and that only after the last Younger Dryas Comet event are the Egyptian sculptures representative of Fairer Skinned people&#39;s.<br>The Younger Dryas Comet event pretty much wiped out everything that had previously existed I&#39;m The Northern Hemisphere including the Megafauna such as the Wholly Mammoth. <br>Just because all of our recorded history exist in this brief &quot;GOLDILOCKS&quot; period of Earth&#39;s mild climate doesn&#39;t mean that this is the temperature that Earth natural rest at. The Earth is in NO &quot;GOLDILOCKS&quot; zone but a &quot;PapaBear&quot; zone. So whether we Reduced Carbon Emissions or not you can 100% expect the Earth&#39;s mean temperature the keep steadily rising. <br>The thing we seriously should be immediately and rather quickly implementing is some form of atmospheric reflective umbrella around certain areas of the Earth to reflect away this overbearing Sun before we all start to fry everywhere.<br>Is it that the Anunnaki were mining Gold in Africa to Block out our Sun and that this planet was once called Nibiru. Maybe they failed there civilisation succumb to 50 degree heat as we even see ancient folk law of people living under ground and in caves. Then once again in a half Earth elliptical cycle being half of 25,000 years 12,500 years Earth was struck by a very large Meteor thus reducing temperature&#39;s dramatically creating an Ice age then in the immediate following 12,500 year elliptical another back to back strike being 12,800 years ago The Younger Dryas a much smaller strike that brought the World out of this Super cold period and set us on our slow course to our ever looming &quot;Global Warming&quot; come &quot;Climate Change&quot;?",0

Have you thought about it?   Have you studied innovation?  Fossil fuels are the foundation of our entire society, not merely for energy but for the production of ALL technological goods, including all renewables.  The way to evolve your energy technology is not to arbitrarily turn off your most important energy source, it is to produce energy as rapidly and efficiently as possible, whilst innovating,   The Mad Max scenario they envision is indeed upon us, it will be a direct consequence of programs like this.  You shut down your most important energy source, then what do you get?  You get a massive societal depression, which directly reduces innovation across the board, followed by environmental degradation which is fueled by desperation.. Anybody who has ever spent time in a 3rd world country can attest to this.  In a 3rd world country, do you get drone technology?  Advanced manufacturing?  New forms of food/energy?  No, you get the opposite.   You get piles of trash by the dirt road.  You don&#39;t get a sustainble eco-friendly paradise.  In many places of the world you&#39;ll get everything unthinkable; war, famine, despotism, slavery.  The places that are closest to a green fantasyland, are actually the ones which are by-products of our most sophisticated technological base.  Places like Silicon Valley, or Seattle.   Taking the actions proposed here..that&#39;s exactly and precisely the OPPOSITE of what you should do if you want an environmentally-responsible future.  These ideas will directly cause cataclysmic problems, and we can see this already happening.  And by the way, what happens when you force this stuff from the top?  Do you save the environment?  No, you wind up burning even dirtier sources of energy such as coal.  Just ask Germany.  You wind up buying your oil from far less environmentally-concerned countries such as Venezuela or Russia.

So, if we have a summer with 40 degrees then to match the 3 degrees you would have to add 16 % which would give you a heat of about 48 degrees. But the problem to get 3 degrees more then the average heat of the see you would have to be also 10% closer to the sun which is not possible. But let‚Äôs imagine that such could be the case, well, we would face lots of rain and worse, many unforeseen floods and hurricanes.

There is at least a decade of heating already built into the biosphere due to the lag between the evulsion of a bolus of CO2 and the full manifestation of the heating it produces.  While CO2 is up 50% since pre-industrial, methane (much more potent a GHG) is up nearly 300%.  CO2 and CH4 are both now freely emitting from melting permafrost...that is a source we have NO control over.  Once triggered, it&#39;s self-amplifying.  Algal blooms on the surface of ice sheets has darkened hundreds of thousands of hectares of ice in the Arctic, speeding the melt.

Several reports from the IPCC consistently state that human activity since industrialization has dramatically increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  This is the result of scientific research by climate scientists, and this is the period when capitalism appeared in full-fledged history.  It is not difficult to understand why capitalism caused climate change through the massive emission of greenhouse gases.  Capitalism aims to produce for profit, and for this purpose, it has pursued production for production and accumulation for accumulation.  In order to support this production system, an enormous energy supply structure was needed to sustain production.  Fossil fuels were chosen for this.",0

2022-06-19T23:28:35Z,@glenpaul3606,"The earth&#39;s climate has never been static...it is constantly changing.  This is not brought about by man but rather is simply nature.  Man needs to find ways to compensate for variables in the climate. These changes in climate would occur without any humans on earth so it is ludicrous to expect changes in human behavior to affect climste.  The planet has been through 7 ice ages and a multitude of other climate changes in between them and this will always continue.  Man needs to find more efficient methods of dealing with climate change but should not expect that man can actually change the climate as that will not hapoen.  Nature is in control.  Our planet has an abundance of fossil fuels and that is where the focus should be for providing energy needs.  America was recently energy independent with a great amount of reserves yet to be accessed such as Anwar.  What man needs to do is place more focus on our ability to keep up with the ever increasing need for electricity.  Natural gas and nuclear power can keep up with those needs.  We should however conserve electricity by using common sense.  Turning off 90% power to the many buildings that are lit brightly all night long when not in use, cutting back on production of electric vehicles as battery technology is far from practical compared to gasoline.  Convert back to MTBE from Ethanol and stop wasting our food supply.  Ethanol damages the environment and is inefficient.  Require cities and businesses to scale down electricity consumption in off hours drastically.  Undo all the restraints that Biden and Democrats placed upon our energy industry.  Encourage world nations to achieve clean air and water levels achieved in America.  Use sanctions if necessary to encourage compliance.   There are many other things that could be done to conserve electricity,  utilize inexpensive fossil fuels, reduce pollution and be prepared for climate changes whatever they may bring.",1

The billions spent by these companies to spread misinformation is unconscionable and does untold damage.

Politicians and government officials are paid by these companies to keep the status quo and do everything in their power to stop climate action. They then pretend to be doing something about climate change and spread misleading information. It is called &quot;green washing.&quot; To learn the real facts about the climate crisis, you have to carefully research using credible sources.

The main problem is that there are to many people making green house gasses in all kinds of ways. Making more cars ,Trucks,planes.and all such is a problem as is cutting down the forest around the world. It finally comes down to human population. The more humans the more the drag on this earth.It&#39;s not just green house gasses,there is going to be a shortage of fresh water for all and food for all.Population has got to slow or reverse or the human will finally destroy themselves.

Also economic inequalities, greed and so many other nasty things as well. <br>Assuming scientists are right that  fossil fuels will destroy civilization, then obviously the time to have prevented the use of fossil fuels would have  been in the early 1800s, at the time of the industrial revolution now about 200 years ago.  If problems have been accumulating since then, it will take at least another 200 years, if not longer, to reverse those trends. It is very likely too late to stop those trends now, let alone in 200 years. <br>It is inevitable civilization will destroy itself before too long, in 50 to 100 years at the very latest, either through climatic changes, nuclear war, overpopulation,  depletion of vital resources, or a virus pandemic a lot worse than the present Covid one.

2022-04-24T17:36:28Z,@DavidElzeitsinfill,"The biggest idea I am trying to express is tunneling aqueducts from the coast, in this case the west coast of the USA inland to feed combination geothermal power and sea water desalination plants.  The idea seems to be so big that no one has considered it possible but I believe it is not only possible but it is necessary. For over a century the fossil water contained in aquifers has been pumped out to feed agriculture, industry and municipal water needs. The natural water cycle cant refill fossil water deposits that were filled 10,000 years ago when the glaciers melted after the last ice age. Without refilling these aquifers there is not much of a future for the region of the United states. As a result ground levels in some areas of the San Joaquin Valley have subsided by more than 30 feet. Similar fossil water depletion is happening in other regions all around the world. TBM and tunneling technology has matured and further developments in the industry are poised to speed up the tunneling process and it&#39;s these tunnels that are the only way to move large volumes of water from the ocean inland. The water is moved inland to areas where it can be desalinated in geothermal plants producing clean water and power. In many cases the water will recharge surface reservoirs where it will be used first to make more hydro power before being released into rivers and canal systems. It&#39;s very important however to not stop tunneling at these first stops but to continue several legs until the water has traveled from the ocean under mountain ranges to interior states. Along the way water will flow down grade through tunnels and rise in geothermal loops to fill mountain top pumped hydro batteries several times before eventually recharging several major aquifers. What I am proposing is essentially reversing the flow of the Colorado River Compact. Bringing water from the coast of California first to mountaintop reservoirs then to the deserts of Nevada and Arizona and on to Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. This big idea looks past any individual city or states problems and looks at the whole and by using first principles identifies the actual problem and only solution. <br><br>Thank you for your time, I would like the opportunity to explain in further detail and answer any questions",0

They retain more solar heat; expanding and multiplying; and expelling more gases. As more CO2 and, at least 10x&#39;s worse (as a &#39;greenhouse gas&#39;), methane are released - temps will rise.

What this video purposely fails to mention is that in the likelihood of a minor temp increase (unlikely) is all the environmental processes by which it would need to raise to such a temperature and all the changes in the environment that will occur to counter such dramatic, negative outcomes. <br>   The false premise is that CO2 levels increased in our atmosphere will trap SO MUCH heat causing a change reaction of effects that will Ultimately result in hotter temperatures. The only problem is CO2 has an absorption limit and won&#39;t allow for permanent trapping of heat. CO2 is a limited absorber of heat and therefore regulates the globe at a comfortable temperature. If excess CO2 builds up, the earth absorbs more of it. More trees will grow and all vegetation will grow bigger. Oxygen levels will increase. There&#39;s too many lies to list üòí <br>   Just know a temp increase to 3 degrees Celsius is not a big deal.<br>  Also the desertification claim is hillarious and outlandish. Like I stated above.

2022-04-10T07:38:13Z,@dageustice,"This is incorrect. I&#39;d love to see your sources. An increase in CO2 concentration creates a feedback loop. An example of this is through ocean acidification. The oceans absorb the CO2, making it more acidic, and plankton and other organisms that produce O2 perish due to the acidity. This means less photosynthesis and more atmospheric CO2. Another example is through the melting of ice caps. When the sea levels rise, more land is covered by water. Land surfaces reflect more light than the oceans, and so more sunlight is trapped, creating more heat. There are many more examples of feedback loops.",1

2022-03-23T07:17:06Z,@GoCanucks2011,"To limit global warming, rich countries like Canada must end oil and gas production by 2034: report  -----------------<br>For the world to have a shot at limiting global warming to 1.5 C, Canada and other wealthy fossil fuel producing nations need to stop all production by 2034, according to a new report.<br><br>The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions required to secure a livable future is ‚Äúfar more challenging‚Äù than any global leader is prepared to acknowledge, said Kevin Anderson, one of the authors of the report and a professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester. Emissions from fossil fuels are one of the main drivers of human-caused climate change.<br><br>Published on March 21, the report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes different phaseout dates for oil and gas producing countries by grouping them according to their differing wealth, development and economic reliance on fossil fuels.<br><br>It found there isn‚Äôt room for any country in the world to increase fossil fuel production, and wealthy countries like Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. must be the first to end production to give smaller, poorer nations an equitable transition and provide them with financial support. The richest countries, which produce over a third of the world‚Äôs oil and gas, must cut output by 74 per cent by 2030 while the poorest, which supply just one ninth of global demand, must cut back by 14 per cent.<br><br>If wealthy countries end fossil fuel production by 2034, middle-income countries by 2043 and the poorest countries by 2050, the world will have a 50 per cent chance of keeping global warming below 1.5 C, according to the report.<br><br>‚ÄúWould we be prepared to put our children on a plane with a 50/50 chance they&#39;re going to land safely?‚Äù Anderson asked. ‚ÄúI think we probably wouldn&#39;t ‚Ä¶ Why is it better to take that risk with their futures?‚Äù<br><br>A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that even if countries act urgently and limit global warming to 1.5 C ‚Äî the threshold scientists say is necessary to maintain a livable planet ‚Äî the world will still face ‚Äúunavoidable‚Äù and steadily worsening impacts from climate change over the next two decades.<br><br>Canada has had a taste of these impacts with the deadly heat wave, floods and wildfires that plagued B.C. last year. Anderson said people in poor countries are already suffering more severe effects of climate change, and warming beyond 1.5 C is ‚Äúnearly a death sentence.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúMany people are suffering and dying from climate change a long way from the places that are causing the problems like the E.U., the U.K., Canada, the U.S.,‚Äù he said.<br><br>The report found wealthy nations must phase out fossil fuel production well before poorer producing nations for there to be any semblance of an equitable transition.<br><br>The authors determined how much economic capacity all the fossil fuel producing countries have by calculating each nation‚Äôs GDP without oil and gas revenues.<br><br>Despite being small fossil fuel producers, countries like South Sudan, Congo-Brazzaville and Gabon have little economic revenue apart from oil and gas production, so rapidly removing this income could threaten their political stability and collapse their economies, said Anderson.<br><br>‚ÄúFor some parts of the world, oil and gas is like 60-odd per cent of their economy. If you remove that ‚Ä¶ they&#39;ve almost got nothing left,‚Äù he said.<br><br>Wealthy nations like Canada that are major producers, on the other hand, have very diverse economies and typically remain wealthy even once the oil and gas revenue is removed, said Anderson.<br><br>For example, the report says Canada‚Äôs GDP would remain the 13th highest globally, even without revenue from oil and gas.<br><br>Oil and gas revenues make up 10 per cent of Canada‚Äôs GDP, according to the report, which is ‚Äúnot an insignificant amount, but an amount that&#39;s relatively easy for us to replace with other sources,‚Äù said Catherine Abreu, founder of Destination Zero and a member of Canada‚Äôs Net-Zero Advisory Body.<br><br>If we ‚Äúkeep up the pretence‚Äù that Canada‚Äôs oil and gas industry is critical for the country‚Äôs economic well-being and it will be ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù to transition, ‚Äúhow can we expect anyone else for whom it is actually much more difficult to do it?‚Äù asked Abreu.<br><br>‚ÄúCanada&#39;s plans for fossil fuel expansion (are) the second largest in the world ‚Ä¶ So Canada is really one of the worst culprits in putting forward plans for this industry that are really out of step with our commitments in the Paris Agreement.‚Äù<br><br>The Canada Energy Regulator says that under the country‚Äôs current policies, Canadian oil production is projected to keep increasing and peak in 2040 before declining slightly, while gas production will steadily increase to 40 per cent above current levels by 2050. It does not include any scenarios compatible with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or holding to 1.5 C.<br><br>The phaseout dates in the report were calculated by taking stock of the world‚Äôs carbon budget, countries‚Äô total fossil fuel production and their economic ability to phase out coal, oil and gas. Although this method allowed some wiggle room to give poorer countries more time to transition, it is ‚Äústill not fair for poorer countries‚Äù and needs to be paired with ‚Äúbig financial transfers‚Äù from wealthy countries, said Anderson.<br><br>‚ÄúOur pathways still (are) unfair on the poorer parts of the world if you look at the total emissions per person over the timeframe that we have,‚Äù he said. The fact that women, children and people of colour are most impacted by climate change points to a broader issue of racism embedded in climate action, or lack thereof, Anderson added, and the institutional racism that exists in the Global North also manifests itself globally.<br><br>‚ÄúWe&#39;ve been highly inequitable to people who have suffered those racial injustices for centuries now and we&#39;re just layering another racial injustice on top,‚Äù he said.<br><br>The federal government recently announced that $315 million of Canada‚Äôs five-year, $5.3-billion climate finance commitment will be available for organizations in Canada and the Global South to partner on climate adaptation projects, but rich countries ‚Äî including Canada ‚Äî are still falling well short of what is needed.<br><br>At the end of the month, the federal government will unveil its emissions reduction plan, which Abreu says is the first step to acknowledging Canada has to tackle oil and gas sector emissions. This report makes it clear we need to be going beyond that first step and account for the emissions from the oil and gas we export, not just production, said Abreu.<br><br>The report does not include negative-emissions technologies like carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions because ‚Äúthey are highly uncertain and speculative, (and) we do not have any examples at scale,‚Äù said Anderson.<br><br>‚ÄúIt&#39;s dangerous to assume that it will work when it&#39;s that uncertain,‚Äù he said, noting the report‚Äôs authors still researched negative-emissions technologies but left them out to avoid increasing the carbon budget without a guarantee it is safe to do so.<br><br>‚ÄúWe always ignore the part of the science that tells us actually, the budgets might be much smaller so your policies need to be much more stringent,‚Äù he said.<br><br>World leaders are gambling if they continue to use more fossil fuels and don‚Äôt act urgently to phase them out, he added.<br><br>‚ÄúWe&#39;re playing Russian roulette with our own children&#39;s futures,‚Äù said Anderson. ‚ÄúThat&#39;s what we&#39;re doing, spinning the chamber with one bullet in it and holding it up to our children&#39;s head at breakfast and saying, ‚ÄòShall we be lucky?‚Äô‚Äù",0

This dilution divides the CO2 temperature by 2,500 for the average temperature, which is no heating at all.<br> <br>Each carbon dioxide molecule would have to be 2,500¬∞C to average 1¬∞C temperature increase, while the CO2 would be a few trillionths of a degree warmer than the surrounding air molecules. A physical impossibility.",0

With both polar caps melting at an alarming rate, they think, &quot;oh well the<br>coastlines will flood.<br>I&#39;m worried that all that additional weight from the oceans is causing major shifting of the earth&#39;s plates.  This may be what caused both the tsunami that devastated <br>Fukushima and the volcanic eruption near Tonga.  I suspect that the climate&#39;s rate of change will become exponential.  I highly doubt that merely limiting the<br>use of fossil fuels will stop climate change.  If we are the cause of climate change then WE ARE THE CAUSE and not so much the technology.  <br>This is about our behavior towards the environment. BEHAVIOR.  Switching technologies, say from fossil fuels to solar panels, will probably make things much worse <br>because switching technologies is what we have been doing for hundreds of years; in other words, switching technologies is the same behavioral error.<br>Each new technology is just another reason to steal from our environment.<br><br>How do we change our behavior?  We know that the behavior in question is our economic behavior.  Our economic &#39;rules of conduct&#39; are the problem.  What is at the heart<br>of our economic rules of conduct?  Profit!  We must profit. We must get what we need to live.  How do we define profit?<br>As of today, we define profit in roughly 2 ways:<br>1.)  Webster&#39;s dictionary has 4 or 5 nice definitions.<br>2.) The capitalist definition.<br> In my opinion the capitalist definition of &#39;profit&#39; reads something like this:<br>profit = the requirement of draining the environment of all resources, including ourselves, because only profits matter.<br><br>I would like to suggest a third, and new, way to define profit:<br>I think that, in order for us to survive and repair the environment at no cost to us, we must define &#39;profit&#39; as something like this:<br>Profit = (the least amount of damage to the environment) + (the equally shared distribution of product).<br><br>How on earth can we live by such a definition of &#39;profit&#39;?  We can keep our technology and our democracy, but we must morph our capitalism with a lot of new sets of laws<br>that will severely punish businesses that try to operate on the old definition of profit.  <br>We must create laws that restrict how much damage any one manufacturing process will cause.  We need a new line of workers<br><br>that specialize in guarding and repairing the environment.<br><br>This is all just the tip of the iceberg.  Applying this strategy to every aspect of the entire global market is a daunting task.  In my opinion any and all further processing of the environment<br>based on our current rules of economic behavior, with false profit, will destroy the entire environment.<br><br>Imagine how much less damage will be caused to the environment when manufacturers can make products that can last a lifetime or longer, and the manufacturers can&#39;t<br>go bankrupt so they don&#39;t have to worry about maintaining the company by robbing Peter to pay Paul.<br><br> If you think we are just going to sweat a little bit think again because the<br>changes will be many and are going to be catastrophic.",7

Not to mention cycles like el ni√±o and la ni√±a, which may influence wrong gut-feeling conclusions in somewhat shorter term as well. Of course, some people would exaggerate in the other direction, and some that it fluctuates wildly from time to time, but the long-term trend is really noticeable only when studying it, the actual temperature record. Sorry if I sound pedantic, I just like to be always wary of even minimal exaggerations because some of the denier types will often have some highly specific knowledge about certain places being colder and whatnot, or that temporary plateau/hiatus (1998-2013, per wikipedia) that happened for a little while, for nearly a decade if I recall.",9

Though it has been well established that it is one of the largest drivers of climate change as well as using up resources that are greatly effected by the rise in global temperature. The effects of large scale industrial animal agriculture goes far beyond the effects of fossil fuel use. Most deforestation (the greatest areas on land of carbon sequestration) is taking place to grow crops to feed to livestock. Most of the worlds fresh water is also used by animal agriculture to grow crops for livestock as well as given to the animals themselves. Our oceans are the greatest area we have for carbon sequestration and yet commercial fishing practices as well as water contamination from land based animal industries are destroying the actual lungs of the planet. Not to mention that methane is several times more detrimental at raising overall global temperature than carbon dioxide. But this video never mentioned a word about it. These aren‚Äôt theories. Hard science has now proven that the way developed nations eat has a huge impact on the entire planet. And it is something we can actually change in a few years.

It has been going on since about 2.5 million years ago (and some think that it&#39;s actually part of an even longer ice age that started as many as 40 million years ago).<br>The curious thing about ice ages is that the temperature of Earth&#39;s atmosphere doesn&#39;t stay cold the entire time. Instead, the climate flip-flops between what scientists call &quot;glacial periods&quot; and &quot;interglacial periods.&quot;<br><br><br><br>Glacial periods last tens of thousands of years. Temperatures are much colder, and ice covers more of the planet.<br><br><br><br>On the other hand, interglacial periods last only a few thousand years and the climate conditions are similar to those on Earth today. <br>We are in an interglacial period right now. It began at the end of the last glacial period, about 10,000 years ago.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Scientists are still working to understand what causes ice ages. One important factor is the amount of light Earth receives from the Sun. The amount of sunlight that reaches Earth can vary quite a lot, mainly due to three factors:<br> how much Earth is tilted relative to the Sun whether Earth wobbles a lot or a little as it spins on its axis <br>(kind of like how a toy top can wobble a lot or a little as it spins) the shape of Earth&#39;s orbit as it goes around the Sun (whether it is shaped more like a circle or more like an ellipse or oval)<br><br>Over thousands of years, the amount of sunshine reaching Earth changes by quite a lot, particularly in the northern latitudes, the area near and around the North Pole. When less sunlight reaches the northern latitudes, temperatures drop and more water freezes into ice, starting an ice age. When more sunlight reaches the northern latitudes, temperatures rise, ice sheets melt, and the ice age ends. But there are many other factors. So if you became a climate scientist one day, you could make your own discoveries!<br><br><br><br>To find out more about Earth&#39;s climate in the past, scientists study ice cores.

We are driving global temps and all the feedback loops away from an ice age. Human activity is now the main force shaping the future of life on Earth. /<br><br>&quot;Carbon has exclusively followed warming and cooling trends on the planet by 300 years and it has been like this for millions of years.&quot; That&#39;s oversimplifying Earth&#39;s history AND how temps, CO2, and water vapor interact. First, at some points in earth&#39;s history, there were massive releases of CO2 which drove warming. Second, the relationship is reciprocal and bi-directional: Whichever you increase first will increase the other. If you increases temps first (as orbital cycles have done), that inevitably triggers more CO2, which triggers more water vapor, which triggers still more CO2 release, more warming, more water vapor, and so on. Thus, a great deal of the eventual warming in past warming periods was actually due to the release of CO2, even if some initial warming was triggered first.<br><br>Third, we know this time around, our release of massive amounts of CO2 is what caused the warming. Natural drivers account for a whopping net ZERO warming from 1880-2020: ALL of it is accounted for by our release of greenhouse gases, deforestation and tilling (which alter the carbon cycle) and the amplification effects of more water vapor caused by the evaporation caused by the original warming caused by more CO2. <br><br>Sorry, we know we caused it this time around. <br><br>Take care.",0

Also, much of the Earth was and would be a  desolate and unlivable wasteland at +3 degrees C or more, so that&#39;s another reason to avoid that.

Richard, I hate to break this to you, but there was no life on land during the Cambrian period--no plants, no animals, nada. The land was hot dry, and desolate, like a Mad Max movie, but without the cars, people, or even dead trees. OK, maybe more like Dune. <br><br>It&#39;s infuriating that all those climate denier channels that make a big deal out of the Cambrian seem to suspiciously leave out that critical fact.   <br><br>&quot;colder temperatures PREVENT DIVERSITY OF LIFE! Got it now?&quot;<br><br>The diversity of life on earth now is perhaps as great as it has ever been AND we evolved in cooler conditions with lower CO2 levels. We&#39;re not dinosaurs, so it doesn&#39;t matter what conditions were even then, because all life on Earth has been adapted to cooler temps and lower CO2 levels for a couple million years, and if you rapidly change the Earth&#39;s conditions, things go extinct. The last time the Earth warmed this rapidly and oceans acidified this rapidly, 95% of marine life went extinct as did 70% of life on land, including everything over 90 pounds. Species can adapt if you change conditions very slowly over thousands or millions of years, but if you rapidly disrupt their habitats, they go extinct: Due to man-made global warming, ecosystem destruction, direct killing of species and chemical and plastic pollution, we are already racing down the on-ramp to the sixth mass extinction of life on earth. <br><br>We can change course and save most of the millions of species on Earth, but it requires decarbonizing our economy and shrinking consumption in wealthy countries to fit within the limits of what the Earth can provide and withstand. <br><br>I hope that helps clarify some things.",0

I&#39;m not saying any of this is politically easy, and solving global warming is only part of the problem--you could solve global warming tomorrow and we would still be heading for ecological collapse.

Earth has limits, and if we don&#39;t stay inside those limits, we keep heading towards the edge of the cliff. <br><br>32 billion acres of habitable land / 8 billion people = 4 acres of resources from habitable land per year, except we have to leave about half of it wild to avoid steady degradation and collapse of ecosystems, so we have to live on about 2 acres of habitable-acre-resources per year, plus what we can get from the deserts and rocky mountains, plus some fish. <br><br>Take care.",0

2021-11-18T07:03:59Z,@paulzozula1318,"I know what you are angling at. But before I say I must add that I am aware that in the past life has endured much higher levels of CO2 equivalent challenges. However, there has been a gradual descent of CO2 concentrations and corresponding global mean temperatures beginning 50 million years ago at the Cenozoic thermal maximum when terrestrial life endured much higher temperatures by habitating the higher latitudes. Much of the oceans may have still have not yet recovered from the devastating effects of the PETM.<br><br>There were two short-lived interruptions, one of which was likely a result of flood volcanism. It provided a mile thick lava cap on the geology of Eastern Washington, parts of Idaho and parts of Northern Oregon associated with the Columbia River basin. Geologically this is considered to be a minor large igneous province or deep mantle plume volcanism. There was quite a bit of thawing at both poles. <br><br>However, ultimately 2.6 million years ago we entered into the ice age described as the Quaternary which we are currently disrupting and departing from. In contrast to Earth&#39;s geologic history during which there have been much warmer periods, even as we have cycled between glaciations and interglacials, we have enjoyed a very mild climate that has fostered abundant and diverse ecosystems both on land and in water. <br><br>With the very abrupt changes that are now occurring this abundance is working against us. On land, more and more it&#39;s biomass is entering the domain of Fire. In water, beyond the effects of overfishing, acidification, eutrophication with subsequent hypoxia, anoxia, and euxenia, along with warming are ravaging ecosystem complexity as well as driving some of the mobile towards the poles. <br><br>Also, under rather thin subsea permafrost perched on the shallow Arctic Ocean&#39;s shelves there are large catches of methane contained in temperature stabilized hydrates, aka clathrates, that have likely been accumulating at least during the last 800,000 years since we had transitioned into 100,000 year glaciation cycles.<br><br>Increasing insolation absorbing open Arctic Ocean water is a very large threat in consideration of the above described situation and large releases of methane there will be much more impactful than normal. Hydroxyl radicals that low temperature oxidize methane into CO2 and H2O form from the photolysis of water vapor in the upper troposphere. There is much less water vapor in the colder Arctic atmosphere. With rapid releases a methane in the Arctic higher concentrations will subsequently there localize to the extent that it&#39;s CO2 equivalent forcing value will be 150 to 200 times that of CO2 rather than the normal quoted value of 86 times over two decades. Thus feeding back on itself visions of the fabled clathrate gun nightmare begin to appear.<br><br>We could tolerate much warmer temperatures by shifting towards the poles. However, currently the dynamic is going to be very challenging for all of life currently residing on Earth.",0

It keeps getting worse, ad infinitum, until we either solve this, or we start reaching levels where human extinction becomes a real possibility (my guess is that&#39;s around the 10 degree mark, based on what I&#39;ve learned about the Permian extinction). The flip side of that is that no matter how bad it gets, it&#39;s always possible to prevent it from getting even worse, so don&#39;t give up if we fail to meet one goal (in fact IIRC stopping a 3 degree rise is already our second goalpost, since I remember a few years ago we were talking about trying to prevent a rise of 2 degrees).",31

In the 80s, greed become the order of the day and Reagan helped undo much of the progress.  In the 90s, people once again starting seeing that we needed to change our ways and there was a social movement to become more &quot;green&quot;.  This was however, once again undone by conservatives who were more interested in protecting profits and starting wars then creating a sustainable world.  Wars, a big housing crisis and social turmoil overwhelmed any attempts to address climate change and then thanks to a brilliant propaganda machine led by Rupert Murdock+, the US had fallen into a state where half the people now lean authoritarian/anti-environment.

The two big complaints are due to their focus on the direct impacts from the environment over the next eighty years.<br><br>First, they miss the feedback loops that the gradually escalating interim crises will create. As rich countries are called upon for aid by their citizens, they&#39;ll be less likely to help poorer countries (witness the lack of COVID vaccines going to the poorest countries), or even cooperate with other wealthy countries (beyond lip service ‚Äî already evident at climate summits). The economic disruption will accelerate as the climate crisis becomes more and more evident, reducing the likelihood that anything ever gets done.<br><br>Second, by pointing to the 3¬∞C increase at the end of the century, they make it easy for people to treat this like a horror story that will maybe happen to strangers. ‚ÄúThat&#39;s a long time from now, surely someone will fix the problem well before then.‚Äù They should be pointing to the unprecedented flooding in Germany, the unprecedented heat wave in Australia, the melting of permafrost in Alaska and Siberia, the fires in the U.S. west ‚Äî all happening now, and all harbingers of worse to come.

No, the fossil record shows it was covered in tropical rain forest and supported the development of early mammals including our primate ancestors. So instead of images of parched desserts, imagine sitting on the treetops looking out over a luxuriant green canopy or bathing in the warm waters of the arctic circle. If there ever was a &#39;Garden of Eden&#39; that led to the eventual establishment of man this was it.  If you are still not convinced you only have to go back to the warmer periods in the Roman and Medieval times.

It&#39;s like adding another blanket to your bed--the blanket doesn&#39;t create any energy but holds in more energy for longer. Part of that is directly held in by the CO2, but that warming causes evaporation and that added water vapor in the sky is responsible for about 50% or more of the total global warming.

It&#39;s a lie. Cutting carbon emissions will never stop climate change. The Sun &amp; its solar wind controls all climate within the solar system. Heat builds up within our planet because of solar emissions &amp; EM friction with the other planetary bodies in our solar system. Indications are that the gulf stream that warms GB and western Europe is shutting down and causing much colder weather. We are more likely to see a 3C lowering of temperature. Do your own research and stop jumping to short-term conclusions.",0

2021-11-04T04:34:41Z,@adultedteacher,"@@EL_Duderino68 Sorry about that. I wrote two replies but I see only one.  I got the info from the HVAC folks who installed my ASHP last summer.  Then I googled to confirm.  Some machines are programmed to turn off about 45&#39;C so as to prevent damage.  Others will run inefficiently and, eventually, will break down. At about 45&#39;C the condensers can&#39;t pump heat into air that is already that hot.  Geothermal is the exception as the ground, aquifer, waterbody  is usually cooler than the air.  <br>I&#39;m in Canada, if that makes  any difference?",0
2021-11-04T05:01:34Z,@EL_Duderino68,@@adultedteacher Thanks for the info Art. I&#39;m guessing that you made an assumption that your air-conditioner represented the majority of air conditioners. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. Again I&#39;m guessing that in Canada they didn&#39;t expect to have to engineer their aircon to work over 45&#39;C. You certainly don&#39;t need  geothermal to do that. e.g. Dubai got to 49&#39;C and the aircon still worked. I&#39;m not meaning to be rude but just saying. Also there is evaporative air-conditioning. Very popular where I live. I do agree the   efficiency of Reverse Cycle air-con decreases with  aircon decreases with more extreme temperatures. BTW I&#39;m not a climate change sceptic in any way. I really worry about the world my daughter is going to be in in even another 30 years. I was just perplexed by your comment.,0

It may seem like China and India are the ultimate culprits who cause climate change, but when you add the historical emissions since the industrial revolution, they aren&#39;t the culprits, it&#39;s the western developed countries. Since the industrial revolution India has barely contribution 3% to world CO2 emissions while accounting for 17% of the world population, where as US has contributed 23% CO2 emissions with just 4% of the world population, and that&#39;s without considering the CO2 for imported products from Asia. The west first industrialized itself and polluted the climate, and then outsourced all manufacturing(which means even the CO2 emissions) to Asia in late 20th century, what happens is that China becomes the largest CO2 emitter, but that&#39;s obvious because it&#39;s literally producing everything for the world.  Its as though the western population got our products and we got their pollution and in the future Asian countries will even get the blame for climate change while the west  must be accountable for climate change if you see total historical emission.üò§üòë The original 1995 Agreement was that the western developed countries would reduce their net emission to zero which would give developing countries &quot;the room&quot; to emit more, develop quickly and switch to greener methods.

Humans have already destroyed half the forests that used to exist and now we are warming the planet 10-20 times faster than it warms when coming out of an ice age. Man-made global warming, with a boost from our pollution and ocean acidification--have now killed off half the coral reefs that existed in the 1970s. Large chunks of permafrost have started to melt and collapse, releasing massive amounts of methane. As a whole the Earth has shifted from some global greening in the 1980s and 1990s (due to our extra CO2 fertilization) to a global browning trend over the last 20 years due to the hotter and drier conditions we have created. <br><br>Due to our habitat destruction, direct killing of species, man=made global warming, and chemical and plastic pollution, populations of all major types of life (except perhaps fungi) are in steady decline and the health of all major ecosystems has been badly disrupted or is in decline. <br><br>Rates of extinctions of species are 10s or times higher to 100s of times higher than the normal background rate and we are steadily moving towards a much less inhabitable earth. Some scientists say that we are already in the early stages of the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth. <br><br>Thus, the people who know the science are anywhere from scared to terrified, and anyone who says there&#39;s nothing to worry about is someone who hasn&#39;t read the science.",1

Up to plus 6-8 Kelvin rise will result. However it will take centuries for Greenland ice to melt away.<br>1200ppm CO2 will be reached, which will see a dramatic increase in plant growth and vegetation density. Fauna will follow flora. Temperatures  on the equator will be only about 2  Kelvin higher, While desert belts will be moved to slightly higher latitudes.<br>No one really believes that energy consumption will stall or even decrease. Economists know this would lead to large scale wars. So if the models are correct this scenario has a bigger than 90% chance to play out. Adaptation is the way that all life goes when climate changes happen. Adaptation is about 90% more effective than mitigation, while resistance leads to extinction , and is the least  (or most) effective depending on the perspective. This is where businesses show their agility. They quickly adapt and everything becomes green and clean, and sustainable, Adaptation is the secret of evolution and the most energy efficient response to climate change. As humans change the planet, the consequence is that they have to adapt.And as humans are very adaptive, most futurists predict a bright, even if slightly warmer future for our civilization. One thing is clear, panic never improved the odds of survival. So we must at least keep our heads cool and adapt. The gap of poor and rich was never a climate issue. It was and will always be a competition issue, a pure free market concept that nature invented to drive evolution. Over sufficiently long periods of time there are no winners and losers. In a couple of hundred years Europe could be a basket case, while Africa is Utopia. Of course, this is not to justify complacency in the face of stark inequalities, but it is a view beyond  human life spans on par with climate changes which always were a main driver of civilizatory evolution. So it all comes down to how much and how quickly we have to adapt. A generational cycle is natural, a higher adaptation rate will cause extra stress. However, with the current measures taken, there will be no catastrophic stress. That would occur with a planet killer asteroid appearing 5 years out from Earth, or the collapse of Earth‚Äòs magnet field. With cool heads and our given intelligence we will learn and adapt and of course survive. We should not spread fear and depression but confidence and optimism, in particular those who have sufficient knowledge on this matter.",2

Depriving those countries of much needed energy sources is what will lead to more poverty, malnutrition and famine, all in the name of the net zero nonsense.

Stop believing the world is full of constants because its actually full of variables and this propaganda relies on us believing and not questioning whilst people like Al Gore make huge sums of money from the green con. There&#39;s 45 times more carbon in the ocean and as the sun heats it more is released to the atmosphere, when the sun is cooler then more is absorbed by the ocean which is why there is correlation with ice core data temp and carbon dioxide ppm and not causation.",0

2021-11-01T01:45:01Z,@graemeratcliffe2498,"According to well understood physical parameters, the effectiveness of CO2 as a greenhouse gas diminishes logarithmically with increasing concentration and from the current level of ~390 ppmv, (parts per million by volume). Accordingly only ~5% of the effectiveness of CO2 as a greenhouse gas remains beyond the current level.This inconvenient fact is well understood in the climate science community. It can be accurately modeled using the Modtran program maintained and supported at the University of Chicago.The logarithmic diminution of the effect of CO2 is probably the reason why there was no runaway greenhouse warming from CO2 in earlier eons when CO2 levels were known to be at levels of several thousands ppmv.Remarkably, IPCC Published reports , (TAR3), do actually acknowledge that the effective temperature increase caused by growing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere radically diminishes with increasing concentrations. This information is in their report. It is well disguised for any lay reader, (Chapter 6. Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: section 6.3.4 Total Well-Mixed Greenhouse Gas Forcing Estimate).Although the IPCC tacitly acknowledges that this crucial diminution effect with increasing concentrations effect exists, it certainly does not go out of its way to emphasise it. Like the Medieval Warm Period, that they attempted to eliminate with the Hockey Stick graph in 2001, the panel knows that wide public knowledge of the diminution effect with increasing CO2 concentration would be utterly detrimental to their primary message.From the present concentration of atmospheric CO2 at approaching 400 ppmv, only ~5% of the effectiveness of CO2 as a Greenhouse Gas remains. This can only give rise to a maximum of a further of ~+0.21¬∞C. Thereafter beyond 1000+ ppmv the effect of increasing levels of CO2 can only ever be absolutely minimal even if CO2 concentrations were to increase indefinitely.",2
2021-11-01T02:17:41Z,@Bookhermit,"Correct, so far as it goes.  However, remember that we have not yet actually reached equilibrium for the current concentration of greenhouse gasses.  We still have about 1 degree C of unrealized warming already in motion.  <br>So really, current and future CO2 output, as you say, have minimal effect - but our past output will keep catching up to us for a decade or two yet.",3

I only ask because we have not reached 400ppm overnight. Yes, we have seen a record increase in the atmospheric level of CO2, and this is certainly, mostly, as a result of human activity, but back in 1960 we were already at 320ppm; so, even then, CO2 had already exhausted most of its greenhouse effect.

Growing Barley requires 100 frost free days, and the Vikings wouldn&#39;t live where they couldn&#39;t make Meade, their favorite alcoholic beverage.  That requires Honey,  so they had Honeybees in Greenland.  Those Viking farms have long since been abandoned, they sit under 5 feet of snow in modern day summer.  In order to do all of that, the average annual temperature of Greenland would have had to be between 6 to 8 degrees Celsius higher than today, and here this video is taking about 3 degrees?  Sorry, but there is no correlation between CO2 and temperature, and even the IPCC admits to only 1.07 degrees warming in the last 150 years.  The temperature forcing factor of CO2 is logarithmic and not linear.  That means total atmospheric CO2 would have to double to produce 1 degree of heat, and double again for each additional degree.

Most of the inputs required for RCP8.5 have already significantly changed.<br>The temperature graphs at 0&#39;32 are using manipulated data. The raw data does not look like the displayed graphs. The 1920s-1930 should be hotter and the 1960s-1970s should be much cooler and the 2000s-2020s much cooler. The IPCC, NASA and NOAA all have published reports during the 1990s that show <b>radically different data</b> to what they started publishing from 2001.<br>Pre-Industrial Era we were going through a cooling climate. So we are measuring from a recent low. Prior to that period temperatures were higher. <br>Cite a source for the 7x increase in Extreme Weather events. So far extreme weather events on land are decreasing. Overall they are increasing because historically we couldn&#39;t see extreme weather events that were not over populated areas but we can now with Satellite coverage. <br>Deaths from extreme weather events and other natural disasters are down 90% over the last 100 years even while the global population increased 300%.<br>Over the last 8,000 years sea levels have risen about 10m. Over the preceding 8,000 years they rose about 100m. There is nothing untoward about current sea level changes. Over the 80years we are likely to see 20cm of sea level rise.<br>All those poor people in Africa shown in the video? They are the ones most likely to suffer by denying them access to cheap power. <br>Most of Bangladesh&#39;s population live in a river delta at low elevations. Its true Bangladesh will be affected by rising seas. 10,000 years ago Doggerland was still habited land but is now under the sea. This is not something new and the geological record suggests that todays changes are very normal.<br>Yuri claims that we have a 1 in 4 chance of 3C. Why? Because he has 4 different models? What are the premises that go into RCP 8.5? RCP 8.5 has one purpose only. To provide click bait scare mongering to try and force change.<br>Cities baking under more extreme heatwaves? What does that mean? Berlins annual temp averages would move from 0.5C-19C to 3.5C-22C.<br>You can get a really bad event in a city in a way you cant in the countryside? Again - what does this mean?<br>Guatemalan rainfall has fallen by less than 10% over the last 60 years. Droughts are occurring now. Droughts also are a very likely cause or co-cause of the Inca and Maya civilizations failing. Droughts are not new.<br>What would the world look like with 3C cooling? Do some modeling on that.

This time she&#39;s created an intelligent herd.  <br><br>But as bright as we are, as intelligent as we appear to be, in a group context we don&#39;t seem especially wise.  In a group setting we are the exact opposite of those past herds who accepted and lived within the constraints of their environment.  <br><br>In fact we seem prone to irrational acts of folly.  Stupidity, self-interest, avarice and greed, is our norm in large groups.  A not especially evolutionarily attractive trait in a species.  So the experiment, overall, seems now to be in jeopardy.<br><br>It comes to this.  We either learn to control ourselves and our numbers, acknowledging that as big as this planet is it is, in fact, a Terrarium.  A closed loop dynamic system with limits.

Lack of education lead to huge family sizes and unsustainable population growth in the 1820&#39;s. When blight hit their only source of food, Irelands poorest 25% of the population died or left the country in one of the biggest people movements of the 19th century.<br>Many of contemporary Irish people like to balme the English alone for the famine but it had many factors, not least uncontrolled family size, no talk of family planning or limiting population growth and over involvement of the church in secular affairs.

Modern countries should be taking the lead in this, yet they don&#39;t, and it&#39;s the poorest ones that suffer because of it. Heavy rain is already a problem in places like Vietnam where flooding happens regularly. Coastal rail lines in England face a similar problem where the sea used to be half a kilometer away in some places just 50 years ago. And it&#39;s also very possible inner Australia will become sea again if low lying areas become inundated with above average levels of rainfall - it&#39;s already happened once in Death Valley a few years ago transforming that into a desert swimming pool.

As for getting that desalinized water to where it&#39;s needed you don&#39;t truck it but rather build pipeline and (using solar) use pumping stations to move it to higher elevations to dams and hydro plants where it can again flow back down rivers helping irrigate farms and eventually to sea level.

Indeed, the evidence of its extreme approach in the news of the grand Quran is that coronavirus invades the world from where they do not know its biological origin to the fact it did not come from the biological nature, rather (it is) a challenge from (Allah) Lord of the worlds; descendants of some Ba-ooda; tiniest creature of which you do not encompass knowledge yet in order for you to know that you do not encompass about a thing from His knowledge except what Allah pleases, glory be to Him ‚Äî and it is from the minor chastisement, thus there is in it wisdom in order to stop the world‚Äôs wheel of life initially including their factory for many months, then Allah would raise the level of climate war; floods, striking mountainous hail divides into deadly shrapnels, drowning hurricanes, tornado of burning fire at forest parks, volcanoes, earthquake, and the entire sorts of Allah‚Äôs climate war by the minor chastisement before the the major chastisement for you may return to Allah! And we fully explained that in detail since a long time ago before the events, surely there is no need to repeat. <br><br>Perhaps one of the questioners would like to say: ‚ÄúOh our Allah, yes indeed the coronavirus came at the year end of 2019 and the whole world been quarantined at the beginning of year 2020, and we said perhaps a harmful thing is beneficial, and we thought that coronavirus is the solution for the global warming problem that Paris convention was unable to solve it, to the fact it halted factories and movement of vehicles, trains, air-crafts and ships, and we were certain that it will definitely reduce the climate disasters because of the reduction of emission of carbon dioxide (pollution) so we said indeed coronavirus solved the problem that the agreement of Paris could not solve it, that the later was requesting fifty percent reduction for several months, yet implementing it was not accomplished due the countries‚Äô (leaders) fear the harm over their economy, and corona came then it stopped the carbon emissions by the rate of fifty percent for several months, and we thought that definitely it will reduce the climate disasters but we got surprised by the opposite! Instead of reducing the climate disasters the opposite occurred to what we expected, in fact, the level of climate war was raised; floods, hurricanes and climate disasters were unprecedented in most places of the world. Coronavirus shattered the theory of global warming due to the fact that the Paris agreement was not implemented as they agreed on stopping fifty percent of the factories‚Äô emissions, but coronavirus stopped it a hundred percent for several months because of the quarantines and overall shutdown. But the level of climate disasters has risen in unprecedented form since the year 2020 and our current year 2021. Surely, theory of global warming has failed. <br><br><br>‚ÄúO Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, surely, your explanatory-statements in various fields where its ratification comes upon the actual reality, and who follows your explanatory-statements knows this since more than sixteen years ago while you deny and disbelieve in the global warming theory and you say: In fact it is (Saqar) planet of fire approaching near the earth of humans. So its impact on planet earth began while it is still at a distant place away from it, and you have many explanatory-statements about it yet we did not believe you, in fact we believed the global warming theory. But the global warming theory ended up failing, so can you deduce for us from from the grand Quran that coronavirus was sent by Allah to ratify your fatwa to crush the global warming theory because to will force us stopping our factories and wheel of the carbon life (pollution) for many month, so Allah would raise (level) of the unprecedented climate war in order to crush the global warming theory?‚Äù Then we reply to the questioner and I say: You would find the news in the word of Allah the Most High: {And those who reject Our messages ‚Äî We lead them (to destruction) step by step from whence they know not.(182) And I grant them respite. Surely My scheme is effective.(183) Do they not reflect (that) there is no madness in their companion? He is only a plain warner.(184) Do they not see the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what things Allah has created, and that it may be that their doom has drawn nigh? In what announcement after this will they then believe?(185) Whomsoever Allah leaves in error, there is no guide for him. And He leaves them alone in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.(186)}Truthful Allah the Great [Al-A`ar√£f] 7:182-186 <br><br>While you till now are not able to know from where Allah invaded you with coronavirus, and it accomplished its mission successfully, it halted your factories, your vehicles, your air-crafts, and your ships for several months to reduce emissions into the atmosphere. Then Allah raised the level of His climate war for you to know that global warming theory is incorrect, then you look at what is around you in the kingdom of the solar system, definitely you would find it abnormal altogether with whatever in it (including) the sun because of an upcoming hidden thing disrupting it! In fact, it will affect everything Allah created in the solar system.

2021-10-30T13:37:49Z,@NickyMitchell85,"Here‚Äôs a way to stop üõë warming of three degrees: it‚Äôs called ‚Äòsolar radiation management‚Äô or ‚Äòstratospheric aerosol injection‚Äô. The idea üí° of flying high-altitude aircraft in the stratosphere ejecting ‚èèÔ∏è the same dust particles that volcanoes üåã emit. <br><br>Mount Pinatubo üåã in the Philippines üáµüá≠ was the largest volcanic üåã explosion üí• of the 20th century. In 1991 it spewed out a huge gas cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è that spread around the globe üåé. Whilst the volcano üåã caused lots of local damage but the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è itself did something extraordinary: it lowered the earth‚Äôs üåç temperature. Sulphur dioxide in that said gas cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è in effect, generated particles that acted as small mirrors ü™û reflecting a fair percentage of sunlight back into space. The amazing ü§© thing is that scientists üë©‚Äçüî¨ are thinking üí≠ of mimicking that effect to counter global heating. How about exaggerating this:<br><br>Let‚Äôs have a situation like üëç in the movie üé• ‚ÄòSnowpiercer‚Äô where an attempt to do this resulted in an ice üßä age. Let‚Äôs add about 500 times as much sulphur dioxide, calcium carbonate and table salt üßÇ into earth‚Äôs üåç stratosphere as carbon dioxide every year until the year 4000 A.D., All governments implementing this. If Mount Pinatubo üåã cooled the earth üåç by as much as 0.5-1C for at least 2-3 years, just think üí≠ how much the planet üåé would cool üòé if we released high-altitude balloons üéà full of said dust particles, flew high-altitude aircraft with nozzles attached to them that are constantly blasting out sulphur dioxide particles, calcium carbonate and table salt üßÇ every year until 4000 A.D. The global average temperature could drop 13C for all I care. That‚Äôd give a 3-degree warming one ‚òùÔ∏è blaze of a beating. I hope ü§û that we implement this, I don‚Äôt care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if it backfires.<br><br>To take out all that carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, let‚Äôs build a huge ‚Äòdirect air capture‚Äô machine that has 1,000,000 units that‚Äôs thrice as high as the Burj Khalifa somewhere in the United States üá∫üá∏ and to further cool üòé the planet üåé, whilst at the same time, providing all our green energy needs, we could cover much of the Sahara Desert üèú with solar panels and solar dishes to provide all of Europe and Africa with plentiful green electricity ‚ö°Ô∏è. All those countries that still rely on burning coal for energy can switch to wind üå¨ and solar and build 150 nuclear ‚ò¢Ô∏è reactors.<br><br>Give it to me, baby!",3
